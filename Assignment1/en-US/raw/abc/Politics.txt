Rep. George Santos on Friday denied a new allegation from Gustavo Ribeiro Trelha that he was behind a credit card skimming operation that resulted in fraud charges for Trelha back in 2017.

Politico first reported Thursday that Trelha, who was convicted and deported to Brazil, sent a sworn statement to federal authorities this week accusing the New York Republican of organizing the operation in Seattle, Washington. The U.S. Secret Service confirmed to ABC News it received a letter from Trelha that is identical to the one published by Politico and that it is being reviewed.

"I was an asset in helping take down a ring of criminals in 2016 who fell on my lap," Santos claimed in response to the allegation. He told reporters on Friday he "instantly started working with Seattle PD" and cooperated with the FBI and Secret Service.

"I did exactly as I was instructed at the time by law enforcement," Santos said. He added, "I'm innocent. Never did anything of criminal activity."

The embattled congressman, who admitted to fabricating parts of his biography and has been challenged on many other aspects of his purported background, is facing multiple investigations from prosecutors and Congress. He's denied any criminal wrongdoing.

ABC News previously reported that Santos was interviewed by the U.S. Secret Service in 2017 as part of the ATM fraud investigation that targeted Trelha, sources familiar with the case said.

According to the sources, the case began when police in Seattle spotted Trelha removing a device from a bank ATM known as a card skimmer, a device used to steal cardholders' information. Trelha had been living in a Seattle hotel where authorities subsequently found multiple card-skimming devices, sources said.

The shipping address on the packaging for some of those items was the same address where Santos lived in Florida, the sources said.

In the recent sworn declaration first obtained by Politico, Trelha said Santos provided the equipment and taught him how to use it, and that they split the profits evenly.

Santos on Friday denied that Trelha was ever his roommate, stating Trelha merely took over Santos' lease when Santos' mother was dying. One of Trelha's roommates then contacted Santos for help when his friend got arrested, Santos said.

"Went down to Seattle ... when I get there, I find out what it is," Santos said, saying that's when he began to cooperate with authorities.

He claimed his cooperation "got everybody arrested and deported" and said he is "adamant" that Trelha lied to the FBI.

Santos told reporters that while there is no guarantee he will not be prosecuted, he is "very confident I can fight this one. It's very easy."Rep.

Gretchen Whitmer, law enforcement and the LGBTQ community, according to an unsealed criminal complaint.

The FBI received an online tip earlier this week from Google about an "unknown subject making threatening comments on Youtube" against law enforcement, members of the LGBTQ community and government officials, the complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan on Thursday, stated.

More than a dozen comments posted between Feb. 18 and March 7 were cited in the complaint. They included threats against government officials, including "im going to kill these democrats biden deserves to die," and "Im more than willing tot kill whitmer and I do live in Michigan. Ill assault her ugly face with my bullets," according to the complaint.

The commenter also allegedly threatened to "kill lgbt freaks and democrat polioticians" and "shoot at" FBI agents if they show up to talk to him.

On March 7, the account was "observed with a display name of 'kill all federal agents on sight and hang biden,' and a handle URL of '@killthefeds420,'" the complaint stated.

FBI agents in Detroit were able to track the account to the residence of Randall Robert Berka II in Sebewaing, Michigan.

One of the account's posts allegedly identified Berka, stating in part, "hey fbi! My name is randall the 2nd and I live in sebewaing Michigan and I am willing to kill these people, f--- it I don't care, f--- the feds, f--- them" and "I'll kill anyone who tries to take my guns."

According to the complaint, Berka was involuntarily committed for mental health treatment in 2012 and was determined to be "legally incapacitated" in 2013. Though he is prohibited from having guns, the complaint stated that his mother allegedly purchased four firearms for Berka but then became scared and "believes Berka should be arrested and put in prison," the complaint stated.

"Berka has ammunition for his firearms and has gone to shoot them; he also possesses body armor," the complaint stated.

Berka, 30, is in custody and has been charged with being a prohibited person in possession of a firearm. A detainment hearing has been scheduled for Wednesday. Online court records do not list any attorney information.

"This defendant's actions were very alarming," James Tarasca, special agent in charge of the FBI in Michigan, said in a statement. "When free speech crosses a line and becomes a threat of violence against another -- aggravated by the illegal possession of firearms -- the full investigative resources of the FBI will be brought to bear. As always, we encourage the public to be vigilant and report concerning behavior to the FBI and local law enforcement."

Berka faces up to 15 years in prison if convicted on the charges in the complaint, prosecutors said.

The alleged threats against Whitmer come a day after a man was indicted after allegedly posting threats on Twitter to kill Jewish politicians in Michigan.

Nearly 15 men were also arrested for a plot to kill the governor in 2019; most have been convicted.

A spokesperson for Whitmer's office said they do not have a comment at this time on the new FBI investigation.The FBI is investigating threats allegedly made on YouTube against Democrats, including President Joe Biden and Michigan Gov.

The Pentagon on Friday released its latest numbers on reports of sexual assault at its three military academies and the news is not good.

This year's survey found the highest numbers since the Defense Department began tracking reports in 2006 and a prevalence survey indicated one out of very five female cadets and midshipmen experienced unwanted sexual contact over the previous year.

For the school year 2021 to 2022, there were 155 reports among cadets and midshipmen, an increase from 131 the previous year with the U.S. Naval Academy experiencing the largest increase in reports.

Also released were the results of the anonymous prevalence survey sent to all cadets and midshipmen normally carried out every two years, although the previously scheduled one could not be carried out because of COVID.

In this Jan. 9, 2014, file photo, an entrance to the U.S. Naval Academy campus is shown in Annapolis, Md. Patrick Semansky/AP, FILE

With a high response rate, the survey is believed to be a more accurate picture than the actual reports that are filed and it estimated that incidents of unwanted sexual contact increased to 1,136 up from 737 in the 2018 survey.

That comes out to 21.4% of female cadets/midshipmen and 4.4% of males experienced some form of unwanted sexual contact in the prior year.

Those numbers represent significant increases over the previous survey that found 16.1% of female students and 2.6% of male students had experienced unwanted sexual contact.

The definition for unwanted sexual contact ranges from sexual harassment to rape.

"These numbers are extremely disappointing and upsetting," Beth Foster, the head of the Defense Force Resiliency Office, told reporters in an audio briefing. "I mean, there's really no other way to see it. Our cadets and midshipmen, our future military leaders, should be able to learn and grow in an environment free of sexual assault and harassment."

She added, "And while these numbers are troubling, it is important to acknowledge that we've had a number of prior indicators that tell us that this problem may be getting worse."

The association of alcohol with sexual assaults at the academies continues.

The report found that alcohol was involved in 61% of the unwanted sexual contacts for women and 58% among male victims. That includes alcohol involvement on the part of either the victim and/or the offender.

"We do know that alcohol is involved in more than half of these situations," said Dr. Ashlea Klahr, Director, Health And Resilience Research, Office Of People Analytics. "When we look across the board we also see really different factors patterns depending on whether or not alcohol was involved."

Protect Our Defenders, an advocacy group for sexual assault victims, released the following statement in response to Friday's numbers.

"This report confirms what many of us have feared -- that the scourge of sexual assault in our military is only getting worse," its statement said. "This report is particularly troubling because it exposes a dramatic increase in the prevalence of this abhorrent behavior at the institutions that are responsible for shaping the military's future leaders. It's clear that more of the same outdated training and attitudes are only making this problem worse.

Ron DeSantis speaks in Iowa as sources tell ABC News he intends to run for president.When President Joe Biden unveiled his $6.8 trillion budget proposal for fiscal year 2024 on Thursday, notably absent was a plan to shore up the finances of Social Security.

Biden's placed an outsized emphasis on Social Security and Medicare since clashing with Republicans over the programs in his State of the Union address last month. He's repeatedly hammered the GOP over the issue, accusing some members of wanting to target benefits as Congress gears up for a battle over the debt ceiling and federal spending.

"I guarantee you I will protect Social Security and Medicare without any change. Guaranteed. I won't allow it to be gutted or eliminated, as MAGA Republicans have threatened to do," Biden said to applause as he rolled out his plan in a campaign-style speech to a union crowd in Philadelphia.

The 184-page budget reiterates Biden's position that cuts to Social Security are off the table, and includes an additional $1.4 billion for the Social Security Administration to improve customer service.

But while the proposal addresses Medicare's solvency, it doesn't include a similar plan for Social Security -- which could see a reduction in scheduled benefits by roughly 20% starting in 2034 unless lawmakers take action.

For Medicare, which is on track to deplete its trust fund in 2028, Biden's proposed tax increases on the wealthy and bringing down drug costs would bolster the program's finances through 2050. The plan was unveiled by Biden in an op-ed for the New York Times two days before the official budget release.

The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, responding to Biden's proposal, praised the Medicare measures but said it was "extremely disappointed it neglects Social Security, putting seniors' benefits at risk."

Andrew Biggs, a senior fellow at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, told ABC News the budget is "scant on details regarding Social Security."

Asked during Friday's press briefing why a solvency pitch wasn't included in the budget, Office of Management and Budget Director Shalanda Young said, "We're trying to protect the benefits that are there now."

"I wish we were at the point of the debate where we could sit down and come up with proposal to extend [solvency]. Unfortunately, it's clear some people want to go backwards ... You're assuming all players are starting from the same place, they're not," Young said.

The problem for Biden, experts said, is that he's vowed not to cut any benefits and to not increase taxes on those making under $400,000 per year -- which will make it extremely difficult to balance the program's finances long-term.

"Under the parameters that President Biden has set out, it's almost mathematically impossible," Biggs said.

During the 2020 campaign, Biden proposed upping the payroll tax to 12.4% for Americans making more than $400,000 per year, among other changes, to help Social Security's funding shortfall. An analysis by the public policy think tank Urban Institute found those changes would extend Social Security's solvency just five years.

"To fix the problem, what he'd have to do is he'd have to find more money or he'd have to cut benefits," Richard Johnson, the director of the Urban Institute's Program on Retirement Policy, told ABC News.

"Changes to Social Security have always been bipartisan, and so it might not be something that he wants to do on his own because it will probably involve some pain," Johnson said.

The 2024 budget stated the administration looks forward to "working with Congress to responsibly strengthen Social Security by ensuring that high-income individuals pay their fair share."

Republicans have been critical of Biden's new budget proposal, rejecting any tax increases.

GOP leaders have said Social Security and Medicare will not be touched during negotiations on the debt limit, though some in the party have previously called for cuts and others have advocated for changes to benefit formulas or the eligibility age.

Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, testifying on the budget on Capitol Hill Friday, was asked by Democratic Rep. John Lawson about payroll tax increases for those earning over $400,000 per year to help fund Social Security.

"I think it is about fairness and I think hardworking Americans who have counted on Social Security and paid into it their entire lives and depended on it as their major source of income in retirement, I think we need to make sure that it's there for them," Yellen said. "And we look for additional revenue to Americans with very high incomes, many of whom in total pay less taxes than a teacher or a firefighter."When President Joe Biden unveiled his $6.8 trillion budget proposal for fiscal year 2024 on Thursday, notably absent was a plan to shore up the finances of Social Security.

National outlets have already picked up her story because of her background as a former dancer at strip clubs.

But Gary says her backstory also includes growing up in poverty in Stafford County, having a premature baby at 17, leaving an abusive partner and eventually turning to a life of ministry and public service.

As for her time in clubs, she said it came about after her son’s biological father came back into the picture.

“Because I grew up in purity culture, I thought, 'Well, ‘I'm broken, so no one's ever gonna want me. I'll just be with this guy who's already awful to me because maybe he'll want me.'“ Gary said. “That continued into more of a domestic trafficking situation. He suggested strongly that I would dance at the clubs where I had gone to just waitress, and that just kind of snowballed.”

Now, Gary has seven kids -- two of whom are active duty in the military -- and she has been married to her husband, Peter, for 14 years. They met when Gary, who was in an abusive relationship, was still working at clubs, she said.

“He just was a friend to me,” Gary said. “He treated me with so much dignity.”

Gary, who has a theology degree, has worked in ministry for years, and she started New Wine Community Church in Stafford in 2019. The former dancer has also served on the Stafford County Board of Supervisors since 2022, representing the Aquia District.

The current Virginia General Assembly has no independent members, and partisan control of the legislature is split, with a 21-18 Democratic majority in the Senate and a 52-48 Republican majority in the House of Delegates. State Sen. Jill Holtzman Vogel (R-Clarke County) currently represents the 27th District, which Gary is running for, though its borders are now different due to redistricting. Vogel is not seeking reelection.

The newly drawn 27th District covers parts of Stafford and Spotsylvania counties and Fredericksburg city. In the 2020 presidential election, Stafford County -- which makes up about 60% of the 27th District -- voted for Biden 51%-47%. Spotsylvania County -- the next largest chunk of the district -- voted for Trump 52%-46%. Biden carried the smallest chunk, Fredericksburg, 66%-31%.

Gary said she filed as an independent because she doesn't want to alienate voters.

"If I put a letter next to my name, immediately half of the population is going to say, 'You're not going to work for me. You're not going to help me and even worse, you're going to hurt me,'" Gary said. "That's not acceptable to me."

Gary highlights three issues on her campaign website: transportation, reproductive rights and education.

The state Senate hopeful touted her tenure on the Fredericksburg Area Metropolitan Planning Organization Policy Board as evidence that she's prepared to tackle the problem of congestion, saying the issue requires nuance because the district has both urban and rural areas.

"We have a very diverse district, the new 27th, which I guess technically there's no incumbent because it's a brand new district. It's very diverse. So we have very rural roads that need improvements and maintenance and then we also have very urban areas like in Fredericksburg," she said.

When it comes to education, Virginia is one of the centers for the battle over school choice, or a policy that allows parents to send their children to private schools and have the costs covered, at least in part, by publicly funded vouchers. Proponents of school choice believe it gives parents a better say over their children’s education and allows some students to leave under-performing schools. Opponents believe it takes funding away from public schools and leaves many students behind.

Gary’s position against school choice is influenced by her time as a public school student and as a mother who, aside from a brief period of homeschooling her children during COVID-19, sends them to public schools.

“This is not going to open up opportunities for most families who may want to utilize those vouchers. It's not going to cover the whole tuition,” Gary said. “So now you already have folks who probably already afford private school funding, but now they’re getting a discount.”

As for the issue of reproductive rights, Gary also invokes her personal experiences.

“I am very open about this: I have had abortions,” Gary said.

After her procedure, she said she “overcorrected” and was anti-abortion, then looked back on how her life would have gone without access to abortions.

“It would have meant staying in a very abusive relationship,” Gary said. “It would have meant ... a lot of awful things continued in my life.”

While her support for abortion rights puts her to the left of many Republicans' perspective, her belief on when life starts differ from the view held by most liberals.

“I'm Christian, and I believe that personhood happens even before conception, right? I believe that God knew me even before I was here and he had a purpose for my life,” Gary said. “But that doesn't mean that I go in and say I believe a, b, and c so you have to do all of these things.”

The primary election for the 27th District is June 20, but because Gary isn't participating in a political primary, her name will not appear on Virginians' ballots until the general election on Nov. 7.Virginia state Senate candidate Monica Gary is open about her past. National outlets have already picked up her story because of her background as a former dancer at strip clubs.

But Gary says her backstory also includes growing up in poverty in Stafford County, having a premature baby at 17, leaving an abusive partner and eventually turning to a life of ministry and public service.

As for her time in clubs, she said it came about after her son’s biological father came back into the picture.

“Because I grew up in purity culture, I thought, 'Well, ‘I'm broken, so no one's ever gonna want me. I'll just be with this guy who's already awful to me because maybe he'll want me.'“ Gary said. “That continued into more of a domestic trafficking situation. He suggested strongly that I would dance at the clubs where I had gone to just waitress, and that just kind of snowballed.”

Now, Gary has seven kids -- two of whom are active duty in the military -- and she has been married to her husband, Peter, for 14 years. They met when Gary, who was in an abusive relationship, was still working at clubs, she said.

“He just was a friend to me,” Gary said. “He treated me with so much dignity.”

Gary, who has a theology degree, has worked in ministry for years, and she started New Wine Community Church in Stafford in 2019. The former dancer has also served on the Stafford County Board of Supervisors since 2022, representing the Aquia District.

The current Virginia General Assembly has no independent members, and partisan control of the legislature is split, with a 21-18 Democratic majority in the Senate and a 52-48 Republican majority in the House of Delegates. State Sen. Jill Holtzman Vogel (R-Clarke County) currently represents the 27th District, which Gary is running for, though its borders are now different due to redistricting. Vogel is not seeking reelection.

The newly drawn 27th District covers parts of Stafford and Spotsylvania counties and Fredericksburg city. In the 2020 presidential election, Stafford County -- which makes up about 60% of the 27th District -- voted for Biden 51%-47%. Spotsylvania County -- the next largest chunk of the district -- voted for Trump 52%-46%. Biden carried the smallest chunk, Fredericksburg, 66%-31%.

Gary said she filed as an independent because she doesn't want to alienate voters.

"If I put a letter next to my name, immediately half of the population is going to say, 'You're not going to work for me. You're not going to help me and even worse, you're going to hurt me,'" Gary said. "That's not acceptable to me."

Gary highlights three issues on her campaign website: transportation, reproductive rights and education.

The state Senate hopeful touted her tenure on the Fredericksburg Area Metropolitan Planning Organization Policy Board as evidence that she's prepared to tackle the problem of congestion, saying the issue requires nuance because the district has both urban and rural areas.

"We have a very diverse district, the new 27th, which I guess technically there's no incumbent because it's a brand new district. It's very diverse. So we have very rural roads that need improvements and maintenance and then we also have very urban areas like in Fredericksburg," she said.

When it comes to education, Virginia is one of the centers for the battle over school choice, or a policy that allows parents to send their children to private schools and have the costs covered, at least in part, by publicly funded vouchers. Proponents of school choice believe it gives parents a better say over their children’s education and allows some students to leave under-performing schools. Opponents believe it takes funding away from public schools and leaves many students behind.

Gary’s position against school choice is influenced by her time as a public school student and as a mother who, aside from a brief period of homeschooling her children during COVID-19, sends them to public schools.

“This is not going to open up opportunities for most families who may want to utilize those vouchers. It's not going to cover the whole tuition,” Gary said. “So now you already have folks who probably already afford private school funding, but now they’re getting a discount.”

As for the issue of reproductive rights, Gary also invokes her personal experiences.

“I am very open about this: I have had abortions,” Gary said.

After her procedure, she said she “overcorrected” and was anti-abortion, then looked back on how her life would have gone without access to abortions.

“It would have meant staying in a very abusive relationship,” Gary said. “It would have meant ... a lot of awful things continued in my life.”

While her support for abortion rights puts her to the left of many Republicans' perspective, her belief on when life starts differ from the view held by most liberals.

“I'm Christian, and I believe that personhood happens even before conception, right? I believe that God knew me even before I was here and he had a purpose for my life,” Gary said. “But that doesn't mean that I go in and say I believe a, b, and c so you have to do all of these things.”

DAVENPORT, Iowa -- GOP Gov. Ron DeSantis' first Iowa swing of the 2024 presidential cycle kicked off Friday in a packed casino room on the eastern side of the state, where he boasted that his stringent conservative leadership style had steered Florida into becoming a model for the rest of the country -- a distinct tease of his White House ambitions.

"Good morning, I bring greetings from the free state of Florida," DeSantis said as he took the stage to loud cheers, touting his state as a blueprint, insisting it has "served as the promised land" and is "the fastest growing state in the country.""And that is a result of leadership. It's a result of vision. It's a result of standing up for what's right," he said.

The Sunshine State leader -- who publicly insisted he wouldn't vie for the presidency this cycle -- was visiting the critical early state as he's privately indicated to allies that he intends to launch a bid for the White House in May or possibly June, sources familiar with the matter tell ABC News.

His trip to Davenport and Des Moines comes days before his presumed opponent and current GOP frontrunner, former President Donald Trump, will make a campaign stop in Iowa on Monday.

DeSantis' visit occurred while Nikki Haley, a former Trump-appointed U.S. ambassador to the United Nations who announced her White House bid last month, hosted a dueling event across the state in Clive, Iowa, with Iowa GOP Sen. Joni Ernst.

Ahead of Iowa's 2024 presidential caucuses, a new Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll found that if former President Donald Trump were to be the Republican nominee again 74% of Iowa Republicans say they would likely vote for him in the 2024 general election -- although the number of Iowans who say they would "definitely" vote for him has decreased by more than 20 percentage points since June 2021.

In Davenport, DeSantis received a warm reception, including several standing ovations when touching on a range of issues from the border to COVID-19 to education. He spoke just under an hour, first from the podium, then sitting down for a conversation with Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds -- another GOP chief executive who gained notoriety for bucking federal COVID guidance during the pandemic -- to promote his new book, 'The Courage to be Free.'

"I've hung around with Ron for just a little bit and I'm here to tell you he is just getting warmed up. So, this guy is a man on a mission," Reynolds said.

DeSantis, who in a the Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa poll had favorability numbers just two points behind Trump's, did not mention the former president directly by name, though he painted a contrast between the criminal probes, staff turnover and communications crises of Trump's tenure to his own administration, which he pointedly says has "no drama."

"The one thing I could say if you talk to Floridians, there's no drama in our administration. There's no palace intrigue. They basically just sit back and say, Okay, what's the governor going to do next? And we roll out and we execute, and we do things and we get things done," DeSantis said.

DeSantis, who has a notably hostile relationship with non-conservative news outlets, was asked outright by Reynolds about his approach to news media coverage.

The Florida governor called legacy media "very, very untrustworthy" in response.

"We just focus on delivering results and delivering the agenda. And I think what people have figured out is, you know, the legacy media is very, very untrustworthy in the eyes of the public," he said.

"Just speak the truth. Do your thing, but do not give them the satisfaction that they are some type of neutral gatekeepers, because they are not."

In a tweet following DeSantis' visit, Reynolds uploaded photos from her interview with the Florida governor, captioned: "The corporate media's worst nightmare!"

The Florida governor rose to national GOP stardom throughout the COVID pandemic, when he kept the state largely open during the early days of the virus' spread and has been vocally skeptical about vaccine efficacy.

Iowa attendees jumped to their feet several times on Friday when DeSantis addressed COVID.

"I'm just proud to say that when during COVID the world lost its mind, when common sense suddenly became an uncommon virtue, the state of Florida stood as a refuge of sanity," he said. "The elites were wrong about lockdowns. They were wrong about forced masking. They were wrong about closing schools. They were wrong about denying natural immunity."

DeSantis also touted his administration's decision to ban "any COVID shot mandates for schoolchildren and university students" and his push against vaccine mandates, saying, "nobody should have to choose between a job they need and a shot they don't want."

The governor also took a swipe at President Joe Biden, calling on him to allow Novak Djokovic, the tennis champion who refuses to take the COVID vaccine, to compete at the Miami Open, despite the tournament's vaccination requirements.

"If Djokovic wants to meet us in the Bahamas, we'll get him over here by boat, get him to the state of Florida so he can compete," DeSantis said to applause.

Ron DeSantis’s first Iowa swing of the 2024 presidential cycle kicked off on Friday.Biden offered his first reaction to cuts proposed by the House Freedom Caucus.

President Joe Biden and congressional Republicans appear no closer to reaching a deal on the 2024 budget to avoid a debt default, with the two sides taking swipes at each other Friday morning.

When touting Friday's jobs report, Biden suggested Republicans weren't capable of drafting a budget anytime soon and blasted a proposal from the House Freedom Caucus, just one day after presenting his budget plan which some Republicans say is "dead on arrival."

"I told the speaker, soon as he's about ready to lay out his budget, I'm willing to sit down. And now I'm hearing things like, 'Well, we're not going to have our budget till April or May maybe even June,'" Biden said from the White House. "Why all of a sudden can't they get it done in March, or maybe even April? Maybe even May?... It doesn't sound like on a level yet."

As lawmakers debate conditions for raising the debt ceiling, a course of action the White House has said should be "non-negotiable," the Treasury Department expects to exhaust its emergency measures sometime between July and September.

With that deadline looming, members of the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus outlined what they call a "blueprint" for spending restrictions on Friday that they say -- if agreed to -- would earn their votes for raising the debt ceiling.

The proposal, which is almost certain to face pushback from more moderate House Republicans, includes ending Biden's student loan forgiveness program, rescinding all unspent COVID-19 federal assistance, recouping the $80 billion allotted to the IRS in the Inflation Reduction Act, and freezing all discretionary spending at the FY2022 level for 10 years.

"President Biden, your budget is dead on arrival. Let me just go ahead and say that now," said Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla.

While the members were taking aim at Biden's proposal with their remarks, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy was a secondary target of the group's remarks. Almost all House Freedom Caucus members speaking on Capitol Hill just ahead of Biden's remarks were part of the faction that delayed McCarthy from obtaining the speakership, highlighting what just a handful of House Republicans can do amid a slim House GOP majority.

"You're going to see us make history again, in this new Congress," said Rep. Bob Good, R-Va., signaling they could vote as a bloc. "We're going to actually cut spending in a meaningful way and put us on a path of fiscal stability as a nation."

The speaker laid fault for the delay at the president's feet.

"Well, we were going to do the budget in April but unfortunately the president's so late with his budget, it delays our budget," McCarthy, who said he's waiting for Biden to invite him to the White House for another meeting, said when asked when he will release his budget proposal.

Back at the White House, Biden slammed the Freedom Caucus's promise to raise the debt ceiling only if 25% of all non-defense spending is cut.

"That means cops, firefighters. It means health care. It means -- that's what they call discretionary spending, as you all know. And, and on top of that, what they're really focused on that I saw here, I shouldn't get into all this now, but is kind of surprised me. They, they want to make sure we don't have enough IRS agents," Biden claimed.

"The idea that I'm going to agree that we start to figure out where we cut 25% across the board .... I don't know what there's much to negotiate on," he added.

White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre echoed his remarks, calling the House Freedom Caucus plan a "gut-punch to the American middle class."

"This is a blueprint for selling out the middle class, law enforcement, and American competitiveness," she said.

Biden's proposal includes $842 billion in defense spending, $6 billion in support for Ukraine to defend against Russia's invasion, a tax increase for high-earners and a $1.4 billion increase to Social Security, among other measures.

The president celebrated Friday's jobs report showing 311,000 jobs were added in February, and he painted a rosy economic outlook for the nation.

"People are moving back into work, but this may be the part that pleased me the most about the report, the jobs report, is people who've been staying out of the job market are moving back in, beginning to move back in. Jobs are available. People are working again. They're becoming more optimistic about their future," he said.

Ron DeSantis speaks in Iowa amid speculation about a presidential run This is DeSantis’ first visit to Iowa, the first contest in the race for the Republican nomination.Norfolk Southern CEO Alan Shaw was evasive at times Thursday when asked direct questions from senators, despite his assurances that he and his company were committed to helping the residents of East Palestine, Ohio, affected by a toxic train derailment last month.

He appeared to dodge in responding to a number of "yes" or "no" questions during a Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works committee hearing on the incident, which has sparked a number of health and environmental threats and triggered political fallout.

Shaw declined to say if Norfolk Southern would compensate people in East Palestine and other affected communities for any long-term medical costs, including medical testing, or economic damages. He also declined to commit to supporting the proposed bipartisan Railway Safety Act, guaranteeing at least seven paid sick days for employees or compensating affected homeowners for their diminished property values.

Instead, he repeatedly answered lawmakers' specific questions on those points by saying the company is "committed to doing what's right."

Senators ask Shaw to answer 'yes' or 'no'

As the three-hour hearing ended, committee chairman Tom Carper, D-Del., said some of Shaw's answer didn't adequately address his and his colleague's questions.

"One of the things I'm concerned about, I'm not a big fan, as I said Mr. Shaw, of yes-no answers. That's not usually my style. But I didn't think we heard as many unequivocal answers -- 'yeses' -- as I might like to have, and we might want to revisit that at another time," Carper said.

He began the panel's probing of Shaw by asking him if Norfolk Southern would compensate the people of Ohio and Pennsylvania for possible long-term medical costs and economic damages resulting from this disaster, to which Shaw responded by saying his team would do "more than less" to clean up the area.

"Senator, we're committed to doing what's right for the folks of East Palestine and the community. That's been my personal commitment since the day after this happened. I pulled my team together. And I told my team we are going to do more than less with the environmental cleanup, and we're going to do more than less with the citizens of East Palestine," Shaw said.

A follow-up question touched on Norfolk Southern's commitment to paying for long-term medical testing for people with known or suspected exposure to the leak of dangerous chemicals.

'I'm committed to doing what's right'

"I'm committed to doing what's right. You know, we're gonna be there today, tomorrow, a year from now, five years from now, 10 years from now," Shaw said.

At one point, Carper pointedly asked Shaw, "Yes or no: Will you commit that Norfolk Southern will be there for as long as it takes to make East Palestine, Ohio, Darlington Township in Pennsylvania, and the surrounding communities whole from this disaster?"

Shaw declined to answer with a "yes" or "no." "I'm terribly sorry for the impact this derailment has had on the folks of that community. And yes, it's my personal commitment that's Norfolk Southern that we're going to be there for as long as it takes to help East Palestine thrive and recover," he said. "That's my personal commitment."

Declines to commit to Railway Safety Act

Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., who is currently hospitalized to receive treatment for clinical depression, submitted a question for Shaw, inquiring if the CEO would support the recently-proposed bipartisan Railway Safety Act.

Shaw indicated that he'd support parts of the legislation, saying he'd commit to "the legislative intent to make rail safer," without saying, "yes."

He said during the hearing that Norfolk Southern had invested in several new initiatives to enhance safety which included more hotbox detectors and installing its first new wayside detector on Wednesday.

Compensation for decreased property values? Paid employee sick leave?

Shaw declined to say whether Norfolk Southern would commit to providing families compensation for decreased property values as a result of the derailment when questioned by Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., instead repeating that the company was "committed to do what's right."

"Well, what's right is a family that had a home worth $100,000 that is now worth $50,000 will probably never be able to sell that home for $100,000 again. Will you compensate that family for that loss?"

"I'm committed to what's right, if --" Shaw said again, as Markey interrupted, saying, "That is the right thing to do. These are the people who are innocent victims, Mr. Shaw. These people were just there at home and all of a sudden, their small businesses, their homes are forever going to have been diminished in value. Norfolk Southern owes these people. It's an accident that is basically under the responsibility of Norfolk Southern, not these families."

Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., pushed Shaw on whether he would commit to giving his employees guaranteed paid sick leave, and was not satisfied with the CEO's response.

Shaw also said that "everything is on the table" when Sanders asked about Norfolk Southern's responsibility in covering health care needs for East Palestine residents.

"Senator, I share your focus on our employees, I will commit to continuing to discuss with them important quality of life issues, with our local craft colleagues,' Shaw said.

"With all due respect, you sound like a politician, Mr. Shaw," Sanders replied.Norfolk Southern CEO Alan Shaw was evasive at times Thursday when asked direct questions from senators, despite his assurances that he and his company were committed to helping the residents of East Palestine, Ohio, affected by a toxic train derailment last month.

Instead, he repeatedly answered lawmakers' specific questions on those points by saying the company is "committed to doing what's right."

Senators ask Shaw to answer 'yes' or 'no'

As the three-hour hearing ended, committee chairman Tom Carper, D-Del., said some of Shaw's answer didn't adequately address his and his colleague's questions.

"One of the things I'm concerned about, I'm not a big fan, as I said Mr. Shaw, of yes-no answers. That's not usually my style. But I didn't think we heard as many unequivocal answers -- 'yeses' -- as I might like to have, and we might want to revisit that at another time," Carper said.

He began the panel's probing of Shaw by asking him if Norfolk Southern would compensate the people of Ohio and Pennsylvania for possible long-term medical costs and economic damages resulting from this disaster, to which Shaw responded by saying his team would do "more than less" to clean up the area.

"Senator, we're committed to doing what's right for the folks of East Palestine and the community. That's been my personal commitment since the day after this happened. I pulled my team together. And I told my team we are going to do more than less with the environmental cleanup, and we're going to do more than less with the citizens of East Palestine," Shaw said.

A follow-up question touched on Norfolk Southern's commitment to paying for long-term medical testing for people with known or suspected exposure to the leak of dangerous chemicals.

'I'm committed to doing what's right'

"I'm committed to doing what's right. You know, we're gonna be there today, tomorrow, a year from now, five years from now, 10 years from now," Shaw said.

At one point, Carper pointedly asked Shaw, "Yes or no: Will you commit that Norfolk Southern will be there for as long as it takes to make East Palestine, Ohio, Darlington Township in Pennsylvania, and the surrounding communities whole from this disaster?"

Shaw declined to answer with a "yes" or "no." "I'm terribly sorry for the impact this derailment has had on the folks of that community. And yes, it's my personal commitment that's Norfolk Southern that we're going to be there for as long as it takes to help East Palestine thrive and recover," he said. "That's my personal commitment."

Declines to commit to Railway Safety Act

Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., who is currently hospitalized to receive treatment for clinical depression, submitted a question for Shaw, inquiring if the CEO would support the recently-proposed bipartisan Railway Safety Act.

Shaw indicated that he'd support parts of the legislation, saying he'd commit to "the legislative intent to make rail safer," without saying, "yes."

He said during the hearing that Norfolk Southern had invested in several new initiatives to enhance safety which included more hotbox detectors and installing its first new wayside detector on Wednesday.

Compensation for decreased property values? Paid employee sick leave?

Shaw declined to say whether Norfolk Southern would commit to providing families compensation for decreased property values as a result of the derailment when questioned by Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., instead repeating that the company was "committed to do what's right."

"Well, what's right is a family that had a home worth $100,000 that is now worth $50,000 will probably never be able to sell that home for $100,000 again. Will you compensate that family for that loss?"

"I'm committed to what's right, if --" Shaw said again, as Markey interrupted, saying, "That is the right thing to do. These are the people who are innocent victims, Mr. Shaw. These people were just there at home and all of a sudden, their small businesses, their homes are forever going to have been diminished in value. Norfolk Southern owes these people. It's an accident that is basically under the responsibility of Norfolk Southern, not these families."

Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., pushed Shaw on whether he would commit to giving his employees guaranteed paid sick leave, and was not satisfied with the CEO's response.

Shaw also said that "everything is on the table" when Sanders asked about Norfolk Southern's responsibility in covering health care needs for East Palestine residents.

"Senator, I share your focus on our employees, I will commit to continuing to discuss with them important quality of life issues, with our local craft colleagues,' Shaw said.

"With all due respect, you sound like a politician, Mr. Shaw," Sanders replied.A key question is whether enough can be produced and delivered in time.

With Russia making its first moves in an expected spring offensive, the U.S. and allies are scrambling to get enough ammunition to Ukraine to fight off what could prove to be a decisive assault -- and to launch an offensive of its own.

As much of the war has shifted to major artillery battles in the eastern part of the country and Ukraine burns through rounds at a high rate, the U.S. and allies have had to significantly boost production of critical ammunition.

But a key question is whether enough can be produced and delivered in time.

A short-term and long-term problem

Last month, NATO Secretary General Jens Stolenberg said, "The war in Ukraine is consuming an enormous amount of ammunition and depleting allied stockpiles. The current rate of Ukraine's ammunition expenditure is many times higher than our current rate of production. This puts our defense industries under strain. For example, the waiting time for large caliber ammunition has increased from 12 to 28 months."

Last week, Ukraine's defense minister, Oleksii Reznikov, told his E.U. counterparts, in a letter obtained by the Financial Times, that Kyiv needed 250,000 artillery shells a month. He also said that his forces were firing only about a fifth of the rounds he said they would ordinarily use.

Rob Lee, a senior fellow in the Foreign Policy Research Institute's Eurasia Program, tweeted, "The single most important thing the EU can do to support Ukraine is to produce more artillery rounds. More artillery rounds will give Ukraine a better chance at achieving a breakthrough in its future offensives and to reduce Russia's advantages in an attritional fight."

A top Pentagon official says it's both a short-term and long-term problem.

"What the Ukraine conflict showed is that, frankly, our defense industrial base was not at the level that we needed it to be to generate munitions," Colin Kahl, undersecretary of defense for policy, told American lawmakers last week.

"Those are going to matter a year from now, two years from now, three years from now, because even if the conflict in Ukraine dies down, and nobody can predict whether that will happen, Ukraine is going to need a military that can defend the territory it has clawed back," he said.

US companies ramping up production

U.S. Army officials and manufacturing companies in the U.S say they are confident they can meet Ukraine's needs, despite it blowing through U.S supplies much faster than expected.

Asked on Wednesday whether the U.S. was caught off guard by how much ammunition aid Ukraine needed and whether it was playing catch-up, Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics and Technology Doug Bush, said, "I believe we are keeping up with the demand. No other country has done what the United States has done here, in terms of having the stocks in advance, having them in the right condition to provide for our ally, moving them there, and sustaining them."

Bush noted that while it is "appropriate for Americans to always ask questions about what we could have done better," he said he was personally "astounded" at what the Army has been able to accomplish.

Currently, a munitions plant in Scranton, Pennsylvania, has increased its production of artillery shells from 15,000 to 70,000 shells a month.

And Lockheed Martin, which makes the High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) the U.S. has sent to Ukraine, is doubling its production of the launchers from 48 to 96 per year, executives say.

Officials at the company's Camden, Arkansas, factory say they are confident they can keep up with the increased pace.

"We're in a place now where we can meet the capacity demand," Jay Price, vice president of precision fire at Lockheed Martin, told ABC News during a recent visit. "We won't have to work around the clock. We ebb and flow. We want to make all of our deliveries on time. So, if we have to work weekends or if we have to go [to] a second shift, we'll do that."

HIMARS have been credited as having an important role in Ukraine's defense against Russia. The truck-like mobile rocket launchers are able to set up, fire and relocate in a matter of minutes after launching as many as six rockets toward a target.

The launchers have been particularly effective in fighting Russia's offensive in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine by allowing Ukrainian forces to strategically attack specific Russian supply and ammunition depots as far as fifty miles from the front lines, slowing their ability to make advances. The system was also crucial in forcing Russia to withdraw from Kherson.

A Ukrainian official who spoke with ABC News in February confirmed that Ukraine's ability to strike targets with high precision has been thanks to support provided by the U.S., which has so far sent 20 of its own HIMARS systems to Ukraine as part of some $29.3 billion in total security aid to date.

A $2 billion military package for Ukraine announced by the Pentagon on Feb. 24 also includes more Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLR) rockets that are fired from the HIMARS launcher.

The United States has also contracted to provide Ukraine with 20 additional newly built HIMARS that will be part of the ramped-up production at the factory in Camden.

Giving Ukraine the 'best chance of being successful'

On Friday, the administration announced another $400 million aid package that included additional ammunition for HIMARS, additional 155mm artillery rounds and more 105mm artillery rounds.

In Tallinn, Estonia, two weeks ago, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke of the importance of the continuing security assistance to Ukraine as it prepares for Russia's "upcoming offensive" in the spring.

"We're going to provide them all the support that we can possibly provide them so that they can have the best chance of being successful in the upcoming offensive," he said then.

Back at Lockheed Martin's plant in Camden, Dennis Truelove, a product manager retiring this week after nearly 42 years, said he deeply believes in the capability of HIMARS and what he described as its fundamental purpose.

"In Camden, Arkansas, our production workers produce a weapons system that is second to none anywhere in the world," Truelove told ABC News. "Somebody's son, somebody's daughter, somebody's grandson, nephew, niece -- lives depend on the decisions that our production workers make on a daily basis at our facilities."

Rep. Anthony D'Esposito and several other New York Republicans are pushing to stop embattled GOP colleague George Santos from potentially making money from his fame if he is indicted or convicted of certain crimes, according to legislation introduced Tuesday.

It's a move that D'Esposito and the others, who have worked to distance themselves from their fellow freshman lawmaker, say is about holding members of Congress accountable -- though Santos was "an inspiration" for their proposal.

"No one should be able to profit off lying to the American people and swindling their way into the people's house," D'Esposito, who introduced the legislation, said at a Tuesday press conference.

The "No Fortune for Fraud Act" would prevent House members "from receiving compensation for biographies, media appearances, or expressive or creative works" if they have been convicted of financial offenses or campaign finance fraud, according to the bill's text.

A separate resolution, the "No Fame for Fraud Resolution," offers a similar proposal that would alter the House rules to prohibit members from being paid for their celebrity status if they are indicted for finance or fraud crimes.

Anthony D'Esposito holds a copy of the "No Fortune for Fraud" Act, a law prohibiting House lawmakers convicted of certain offenses from profiting off their fabrications, during a press conference on Capitol Hill in Washington, March 7, 2023.

"If you're defrauding the American people, if you're making a mockery out of the people's house or violating campaign finance law, you should not be able to turn it into a payday," D'Esposito said at the press conference, where he introduced the two pieces of legislation.

The legislation is co-sponsored by New York freshmen Republicans Reps. Nick LaLota, Nick Langworthy, Mike Lawler, Marc Molinaro and Brandon Williams.

"He's trying to use his new infamy to enrich himself, to further what he set out to do three years ago, to use his persona as a public figure to enrich himself," LaLota argued to reporters on Tuesday. "And we New York Republicans can smell a scam from a mile away. And George Santos' scam absolutely stinks."

D'Esposito said that the group of lawmakers has had conversations with GOP leadership about their legislation and are "confident" that it will make it to the House floor for consideration.

While Santos' name isn't specifically mentioned in the text or resolution, a spokesperson for D'Esposito told ABC News that "Santos was certainly an inspiration for it."

In a statement to ABC News, a spokesperson for Santos initially said, "It is unfortunate that after two years of abysmal policies that been put forth by House Democrats and the Biden Administration that there is a legislative focus on a specific Member of Congress. As a legislative body, our top priorities should be tackling high inflation as well as reducing high levels of crime."

On Thursday, however, Santos said he wanted to be a co-sponsor of the legislation -- which D'Esposito quickly rejected.

"It's a good bill," Santos told ABC News. He wrote a letter to D'Esposito's office asking to be "added as a cosponsor."

"If he's serious about legislating, serious about getting this done, I think we should all work on it together to get it done," Santos said when asked if he thought he would be added as a supporter of the proposal.

But D'Esposito poured cold water on that idea, saying "absolutely not."

"We are into good governance and that's why we put the bill forth," he said. "[Santos] is the poster child of not good governance."

D'Esposito had said Tuesday that he could both fight for his district while also pushing for accountability for controversial members like Santos.

"I gave my word to the people of the 4th Congressional District back in Nassau County that I would fight for them, for their interests and for community values. Now as members of Congress, we're going to continue to do that. But we're going to hold those accountable that have violated the trust of not only the American people, but the people of the great state of New York," he said.

Santos, who has admitted lying about parts of his biography while being challenged about other parts of his life, such as how his mother died, faces multiple probes from prosecutors in New York as well as Congress, amid calls for his resignation.

He has denied criminal wrongdoing and insisted he will continue to serve his constituents.

The House Ethics Committee announced last week that it had voted to establish an "Investigative Subcommittee" into Santos to look into numerous allegations against him, including about his campaign finances.

Santos previously told ABC News he would "100%" comply with the Ethics Committee's investigation.A Santos spokesperson pushed back, then he said he wanted to be a co-sponsor.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell remained in the hospital Thursday and was being treated for a concussion following a fall at a Washington, D.C., hotel Wednesday night.

"Leader McConnell tripped at a dinner event Wednesday evening and has been admitted to the hospital and is being treated for a concussion. He is expected to remain in the hospital for a few days of observation and treatment. The Leader is grateful to the medical professionals for their care and to his colleagues for their warm wishes," McConnell's communications director David Popp told ABC News Thursday afternoon.

Sen. John Barrasso, the Senate's No. 3 Republican, who is also a physician, told reporters McConnell is alert and talking.

"He's gonna be observed which is concussion protocol. I expect him to make a full recovery and be back here next week," Barrasso said as he left a meeting where Republican senators were briefed by McConnell's team.

The hotel where the fall occurred, sources said, was the Waldorf Astoria, formerly the Trump International Hotel.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Thursday he spoke with McConnell's staff after reaching out to his colleague.

"First, my thoughts this morning are with my good friend, Leader Mitch McConnell, who's recovering from in the hospital after an accident last night," Schumer said in remarks on the Senate floor. "This morning I offer a prayer of strength and healing for the leader and his family. I called the leader this morning and spoke briefly with his staff to extend my prayers and well wishes. My thoughts are also with Leader McConnell's family and his team. I join every single one of my colleagues in wishing Leader McConnell a speedy and full recovery."

House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said he hadn't spoken with McConnell either but hopes to do so later.

"We are just checking, trying to get an update on the senator. I know he tripped last night, but I don't have any new information," McCarthy told reporters. "I haven't been able to talk to him. Because I was in meetings. Hopefully, I'll be able to talk to him today."

House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., wished McConnell a speedy recovery at the top of his weekly press conference.

"Let me begin by extending on behalf of House Democrats with thoughts and prayers and best wishes to Senate Minority Leader, Mitch McConnell. We are praying for a swift and a full and a speedy recovery and we stand with him and his family in that regard," Jeffries said.

President Joe Biden tweeted Thursday afternoon that he and the first lady "are wishing Senator McConnell a speedy recovery" and "look forward to seeing him back on the Senate floor."

Arriving back at the White House later Thursday, Biden told the press that he's spoken to McConnell's family and thinks the leader will be okay.

"I've spoken to the family," Biden said. "I think he's gonna be all right."

McConnell, who's 81, has walked with a limp after overcoming polio at a young age and suffered a fall in early August 2019, fracturing his shoulder.

He has served as Senate Republican leader since 2007 and became the longest-serving party leader in the history of the Senate earlier this year.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell remained in the hospital Thursday and was being treated for a concussion following a fall at a Washington, D.C., hotel Wednesday night.

"Leader McConnell tripped at a dinner event Wednesday evening and has been admitted to the hospital and is being treated for a concussion. He is expected to remain in the hospital for a few days of observation and treatment. The Leader is grateful to the medical professionals for their care and to his colleagues for their warm wishes," McConnell's communications director David Popp told ABC News Thursday afternoon.

Sen. John Barrasso, the Senate's No. 3 Republican, who is also a physician, told reporters McConnell is alert and talking.

"He's gonna be observed which is concussion protocol. I expect him to make a full recovery and be back here next week," Barrasso said as he left a meeting where Republican senators were briefed by McConnell's team.

The hotel where the fall occurred, sources said, was the Waldorf Astoria, formerly the Trump International Hotel.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Thursday he spoke with McConnell's staff after reaching out to his colleague.

"First, my thoughts this morning are with my good friend, Leader Mitch McConnell, who's recovering from in the hospital after an accident last night," Schumer said in remarks on the Senate floor. "This morning I offer a prayer of strength and healing for the leader and his family. I called the leader this morning and spoke briefly with his staff to extend my prayers and well wishes. My thoughts are also with Leader McConnell's family and his team. I join every single one of my colleagues in wishing Leader McConnell a speedy and full recovery."

House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said he hadn't spoken with McConnell either but hopes to do so later.

"We are just checking, trying to get an update on the senator. I know he tripped last night, but I don't have any new information," McCarthy told reporters. "I haven't been able to talk to him. Because I was in meetings. Hopefully, I'll be able to talk to him today."

House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., wished McConnell a speedy recovery at the top of his weekly press conference.

"Let me begin by extending on behalf of House Democrats with thoughts and prayers and best wishes to Senate Minority Leader, Mitch McConnell. We are praying for a swift and a full and a speedy recovery and we stand with him and his family in that regard," Jeffries said.

President Joe Biden tweeted Thursday afternoon that he and the first lady "are wishing Senator McConnell a speedy recovery" and "look forward to seeing him back on the Senate floor."

Arriving back at the White House later Thursday, Biden told the press that he's spoken to McConnell's family and thinks the leader will be okay.

"I've spoken to the family," Biden said. "I think he's gonna be all right."

There's optimism in the Republican conference about the health of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell after lawmakers were briefed on McConnell's condition by his longtime aide and current chief of staff, Sharon Soderstrom, during a closed-door lunch on Thursday.

Sodesterom told the members that her boss is alert, talking and expected to make a full recovery from a fall and concussion he suffered while attending a dinner at a Washington hotel on Wednesday night.

"Wish him well. He's a tough old crow, so my money is on Mitch," Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told ABC News Senior Congressional Correspondent Rachel Scott.

Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso, the No. 3 Republican in the chamber and a doctor, confirmed that McConnell, who is 81, has been up and speaking.

"He's gonna be observed, which is a concussion protocol," Barrasso said. "I expect him to make a full recovery and be back here next week."

"I'm told he's in good spirits, so that tells me that he's recovering well," said Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., also a physician.

When asked if it is unusual to keep McConnell in the hospital for multiple days, Cassidy said he would not "second-guess the doctors. He is the majority leader, right? So it may just be that it's a little dose of being extra careful. But there's nothing wrong with that."

Another doctor-turned-senator, Kansas Republican Roger Marshall, said that the care McConnell is receiving is "typical" of a concussion. He "absolutely" expects McConnell to make a full recovery, he said.

It remains unclear when McConnell will return to the Senate. Some Republicans are optimistic it could be as soon as next week.

"Leader McConnell tripped at a dinner event Wednesday evening and has been admitted to the hospital and is being treated for a concussion.

Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said after Thursday's conference lunch that "hopefully he'll be back next Tuesday when kind of we're up and running."

"Just knowing him, I'm sure he's watching C-SPAN," Rubio said.

While McConnell recovers, he has a care package on the way. Every year, right around the time of the Iditarod, the famed sled dog race, Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski hosts a smorgasbord of her state's favorite foods -- salmon, her mom's recipe for halibut and reindeer sausage.

McConnell, she said, loves the halibut.

"When I saw the news last night that the leader was in the hospital, I'm like, 'Oh my gosh, he's going to miss his favorite lunch!' So I made sure that he had a little to-go pack to make sure that it's gonna lift his spirits," Murkowski told ABC News.

"They just said that, you know, he's in good spirits," Murkowski continued. "Hopefully now he'll be in better spirits," she said. "What we're all doing is just making sure that he follows doctor's orders."

Louisiana Sen. John Kennedy described his party's Senate leader -- the longest-serving person ever in that role -- as "tough as a boot ... He's gonna be fine."

"The report was very encouraging," said Sen Ted Cruz, R-Texas.

McConnell's Kentucky colleague, Sen. Rand Paul, said senators had learned nothing more than what was released publicly but repeatedly said, "We wish him well."

The Senate's No. 2 Republican, South Dakota's John Thune, said he did not want to "speculate" on whether the chamber was preparing to run without McConnell present next week.

"We'll get him back as soon as possible. I think it's just a question of when," Thune said.

In either case, his absence will be felt.

"He is essential to the leadership of how the Senate works. There's a lot of negotiations that take place between [Democratic] leader [Chuck] Schumer and leader McConnell as to what will come to the fore and what will be the process," Cassidy said, "and no one does it better than Mitch.

President Joe Biden on Thursday rolled out his proposed budget for fiscal year 2024, casting it as a reflection of his values ahead of an anticipated reelection run and aiming to put Republicans on the defensive.

The White House said the budget would reduce the deficit in the long-term by $3 trillion, largely due to tax increases on wealthy Americans and corporations. It would also provide a record amount for defense spending, and include funds for Biden's pledges on paid family leave, universal preschool and more.

"I value everyone having an even shot, not just labor but small business owners, farmers and so many other people who hold the country together who've been basically invisible for a long time," Biden said in a speech before a union audience at the Finishing Trades Institute in Pennsylvania.

Biden's trip to Philadelphia, the site of his 2020 campaign headquarters and his prime-time speech ahead of the 2022 midterms about threats to democracy, signals a once arbitrary budget process is part of a wider push to connect with voters.

He emphasized giving families "breathing room" as he told personal anecdotes about Americans worrying about medical bills, child care and educational opportunities.

"My budget reflects what we can do to lift the burden and hardworking Americans," he said.

Biden's budget release comes as a larger spending fight looms on Capitol Hill with lawmakers facing a summer deadline to lift the debt ceiling or risk an unprecedented default. His proposal is all but dead-on-arrival, as congressional Republicans are generally opposed to any tax increases.

House Republicans have insisted on significant spending cuts in exchange for raising the debt ceiling to avoid an economically disastrous default, though they've yet to reveal they want in and out of the budget. Democrats have called for a "clean" increase to the debt ceiling not tied to federal spending.

House Speaker Kevin McCarthy on Wednesday accused Biden of delaying debt ceiling talks, and said Republicans will need to examine his budget proposal before releasing one of their own.

Biden shot back in his speech Thursday that he's ready for a sit down again with McCarthy "at any time."

"Tomorrow, if he has his budget," Biden said. "Lay it down, tell me what you want to do. I'll show you what I want to do. See what we can agree on."

Biden's proposed budget includes $842 billion in defense spending, as well as $6 billion in support for Ukraine amid Russia's ongoing invasion.

Among the major domestic spending proposals included in the budget are a national paid family and medical leave program providing up to 12 weeks of leave; universal preschool; and funding to expand free community college. It would also provide $25 billion for immigration enforcement and $5 billion in new election assistance funding. The budget also proposes expanding the Child Tax Credit from $2,000 per child to $3,600 for children under age 6 and $3,000 for older children.

To pay for the proposals, Biden is proposing a 25% minimum tax on billionaires and reversing two Trump-era tax cuts: raising the corporate tax from 21% to 28% restoring a 39.6% rate for single filers making over $400,000 and couples earning more than $450,000 annually.Biden's budget as proposed is all but dead-on-arrival, as congressional Republicans are generally opposed to any tax increases.

House Republican leaders called Biden's proposal "unserious" in a statement Thursday.

"President Joe Biden's budget is a reckless proposal doubling down on the same Far Left spending policies that have led to record inflation and our current debt crisis," House GOP leadership stated.

McCarthy said Wednesday Democrats were "wrong" to advocate for a clean raise to the debt ceiling after members received a briefing by the Congressional Budget Office, which recently projected the U.S. will add $19 trillion to the federal debt over the next decade.

"We can no longer ignore the major problem that we have: the size of our debt," McCarthy told reporters. "One thing we have learned through all history: every great society has collapsed after they overextended themselves."

Amid the budget battle, Biden's sought to draw a red line on Medicare and Social Security, which together take up a large part of the budget, going after some in the GOP he says want to gut the programs. McCarthy said Medicare and Social Security are off the table in upcoming negotiations.

Ahead of the broader rollout, Biden on Tuesday released his plan to shore up Medicare's finances through 2050 as the program faces a funding shortfall that could result in benefit reductions by the end of the decade. The plan includes a tax increase on high-earners and expanding drug pricing controls.

For Social Security, the budget would allocate a $1.4 billion increase to the agency to improve customer service. However, it didn't include a similar plan to shore up the Social Security's finances amid a shortfall that could result in a reduction in scheduled benefits starting in 2034.

"The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to strengthen Social Security by ensuring high-income individuals pay their fair share," the administration said in the budget.Biden said the budget would reduct the deficit by nearly $3 trillion.

Amid a flurry of activity from House Republicans regarding Jan. 6, including Speaker Kevin McCarthy sharing security footage from the U.S. Capitol attack exclusively with Fox News' Tucker Carlson, a Republican-led committee has now launched a formal probe into the riot two years ago and the select committee that subsequently investigated it in the last Congress.

Georgia Republican Rep. Barry Loudermilk -- whom the House select committee on Jan. 6 had suggested was linked to a tour through parts of the Capitol on the day before the attack -- will lead the new probe focusing on reviewing the security failures of that day and the earlier committee’s work, Loudermilk's office confirmed to ABC News.

The House Administration Committee has also created an online portal to collect tips from the public.

“The Subcommittee on Oversight is dedicated to following the facts, not a particular political narrative. We are focused on finding out what really happened on January 6 so we can ensure it never happens again,” Loudermilk said in a statement to ABC News.

The news was first reported by CNN.

In a letter late last year, McCarthy wrote to the then-chairman of the Jan. 6 select committee, Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., telling his panel to preserve all the evidence and records it had and said that Republicans intended to hold hearings about the security failures on Jan. 6 once they took the House.

Prior to retaking the majority, some Republicans teased for months their plans to investigate the investigators on the Jan. 6 committee, which issued a final report late last year after approximately 18 months of work, nine public hearings and hundreds of interviews.

The Jan. 6 committee also referred former President Donald Trump and others to the Justice Department for "possible prosecution ... including for assisting and providing aid and comfort to an insurrection," as described in the report.

The committee called Trump the "central cause" of the riot. He denies wrongdoing.

The 42-year-old announced he will be running for Congress as a Democrat in California's 30th district, which is currently held by Rep. Adam Schiff. Schiff has announced he is running to replace the retiring Sen. Dianne Feinstein.

Savage spoke with GMA 3 Thursday about his goals and campaign.

Congressional Candidate Ben Savage speaks to "GMA 3," on March 9, 2023. ABC News

GMA 3: You are best known as an actor, but you studied political science at Stanford University, even interned for the late Sen. Arlen Specter. You also ran for city council in West Hollywood as early as last year, as recently as last year. So tell us what got you interested in politics?

BEN SAVAGE: It's a great question. You know what? I grew up in a household that was very passionate about politics; from a very young age that was instilled in us as children. I grew up in a household that revered RFK, that revered JFK. When I first started running for politics, my mom gave me her John F. Kennedy button that she used to wear in elementary school.

And I have that in my house now, and I think it was just always instilled in us to stand up for our community and our country and try and do the right thing on behalf of our community. So that's always been instilled in me. I'm very passionate about politics. I studied it in college and I'm really looking forward to giving back to the community and standing up for what I think is right.

GMA 3: And Ben, you've said that it's time to run because you want to restore faith in government by offering reasonable, innovative and compassionate solutions to our country's most pressing issues. So what do you believe are some of those issues and what are your plans to resolve them?

SAVAGE: Great question. And Rhiannon [Ally], I've heard you say this on this show before, but it's about doing good and it's about doing the right thing. So of course, issues like housing, homelessness and health care are very important and they're near and dear to my heart. But it's really about changing the tone.

I think there's a negativity in Washington, D.C., that we need to address. We need to bring more young people into the political process. We need to increase civility. We need to work on getting things done in Washington, D.C. We need to be more of a solutions-based government and prominently and preeminently we need to restore faith in government, which I think is lacking right now.

GMA 3: So specifically, California's 30th is a very diverse district. You have large Hispanic and Asian American communities. How do you plan, if you are representing all of--all of the district to represent them all in Washington?

SAVAGE: Great question. And I think, again, it's about bringing people together. I've always been associated with art projects in the entertainment industry that are usually focused around themes of bringing people together, inspiring passion and encouraging people to do good. So that's very near and dear to my heart.

And really, to be honest, I'm a minority myself and I take great issue with the rise of antisemitism that's going on in this country and across this country. And I think that that, too, is something that needs to be addressed. But again, for me, it's about bringing people together and bringing young, passionate, energetic leaders to the table that are really focused on solutions and bringing people together.

GMA 3: And Ben, crime, we know, has become a really big issue in a lot of major cities in the U.S. In fact, L.A. actually recorded its highest annual number of homicides in 15 years during the pandemic. So you say you're laser focused on this. How will you address crime in that area?

SAVAGE: It's a great question. And again, I think that's an all-hands-on-deck approach. And there is no silver bullet answer to that. Of course, it's about supporting our sheriff's department and making sure that they have the proper resources and funding that they need. But it's also about investing in clinical health services, mental health programs, low-income housing and affordable housing to ensure that people who are experiencing homelessness have more opportunities.

That includes job training, that includes, again, mental health services. So I think we really need to bring the best and the brightest to the table and come up with real solutions rather than trying to make this a black or white issue or there is no single answer, basically.

GMA 3: And Ben, as we mentioned, you actually ran for office before quite a few years before. And we actually have a clip that we want to play. So we'll just take a look at this with you. OK?

SAVAGE: Yeah, OK.

GMA 3: Obviously, a clip from "Boy Meets World," but that is passion. That is a fire in your belly. Is that what we're going to see? And does any part of that message still stand today?

SAVAGE: I think I'd be wearing a better shirt, that was a little oversized.

GMA 3: It was the '90s.

SAVAGE: It was the '90s. That was a big trend. I think again, that goes back to the theme that I've always been passionate about politics and I've always been about doing good. And I think we could use more people in Washington, D.C., that are passionate, that are energetic and they're eager to do the right thing and are not about special interests but are about serving the American people."Boy Meets World" actor Ben Savage is taking on a new role on an entirely different stage.

The 42-year-old announced he will be running for Congress as a Democrat in California's 30th district, which is currently held by Rep. Adam Schiff. Schiff has announced he is running to replace the retiring Sen. Dianne Feinstein.

Savage spoke with GMA 3 Thursday about his goals and campaign.

Congressional Candidate Ben Savage speaks to "GMA 3," on March 9, 2023. ABC News

GMA 3: You are best known as an actor, but you studied political science at Stanford University, even interned for the late Sen. Arlen Specter. You also ran for city council in West Hollywood as early as last year, as recently as last year. So tell us what got you interested in politics?

BEN SAVAGE: It's a great question. You know what? I grew up in a household that was very passionate about politics; from a very young age that was instilled in us as children. I grew up in a household that revered RFK, that revered JFK. When I first started running for politics, my mom gave me her John F. Kennedy button that she used to wear in elementary school.

And I have that in my house now, and I think it was just always instilled in us to stand up for our community and our country and try and do the right thing on behalf of our community. So that's always been instilled in me. I'm very passionate about politics. I studied it in college and I'm really looking forward to giving back to the community and standing up for what I think is right.

GMA 3: And Ben, you've said that it's time to run because you want to restore faith in government by offering reasonable, innovative and compassionate solutions to our country's most pressing issues. So what do you believe are some of those issues and what are your plans to resolve them?

SAVAGE: Great question. And Rhiannon [Ally], I've heard you say this on this show before, but it's about doing good and it's about doing the right thing. So of course, issues like housing, homelessness and health care are very important and they're near and dear to my heart. But it's really about changing the tone.

I think there's a negativity in Washington, D.C., that we need to address. We need to bring more young people into the political process. We need to increase civility. We need to work on getting things done in Washington, D.C. We need to be more of a solutions-based government and prominently and preeminently we need to restore faith in government, which I think is lacking right now.

GMA 3: So specifically, California's 30th is a very diverse district. You have large Hispanic and Asian American communities. How do you plan, if you are representing all of--all of the district to represent them all in Washington?

SAVAGE: Great question. And I think, again, it's about bringing people together. I've always been associated with art projects in the entertainment industry that are usually focused around themes of bringing people together, inspiring passion and encouraging people to do good. So that's very near and dear to my heart.

And really, to be honest, I'm a minority myself and I take great issue with the rise of antisemitism that's going on in this country and across this country. And I think that that, too, is something that needs to be addressed. But again, for me, it's about bringing people together and bringing young, passionate, energetic leaders to the table that are really focused on solutions and bringing people together.

GMA 3: And Ben, crime, we know, has become a really big issue in a lot of major cities in the U.S. In fact, L.A. actually recorded its highest annual number of homicides in 15 years during the pandemic. So you say you're laser focused on this. How will you address crime in that area?

SAVAGE: It's a great question. And again, I think that's an all-hands-on-deck approach. And there is no silver bullet answer to that. Of course, it's about supporting our sheriff's department and making sure that they have the proper resources and funding that they need. But it's also about investing in clinical health services, mental health programs, low-income housing and affordable housing to ensure that people who are experiencing homelessness have more opportunities.

That includes job training, that includes, again, mental health services. So I think we really need to bring the best and the brightest to the table and come up with real solutions rather than trying to make this a black or white issue or there is no single answer, basically.

GMA 3: And Ben, as we mentioned, you actually ran for office before quite a few years before. And we actually have a clip that we want to play. So we'll just take a look at this with you. OK?

SAVAGE: Yeah, OK.

Republican Perry Johnson kicked off his 2024 presidential campaign amid the Conservative Political Action Conference last week.Norfolk Southern CEO Alan Shaw faced a Senate grilling Thursday as Washington lawmakers held their first hearing on railroad safety about a month after a train carrying toxic chemicals derailed in East Palestine, Ohio.

Senate Environment and Public Works Committee Chairman Tom Carper, D-Del. pointedly asked Shaw: "Yes or no: Will you commit that Norfolk Southern will be there for as long as it takes to make East Palestine, Ohio, Darlington Township in Pennsylvania, and the surrounding communities whole from this disaster?"

"I'm terribly sorry for the impact this derailment has had on the folks of that community. And yes, it's my personal commitment that's Norfolk Southern that we're going to be there for as long as it takes to help East Palestine thrive and recover. That's my personal commitment," Shaw responded during a hearing that spanned more than three hours.

"I am determined to make this right. Norfolk Southern will claim the site safely, thoroughly and with urgency. You have my personal commitment," he said earlier in his opening statement.

On the eve of his Senate testimony, Shaw said his company was committed to improve rail safety in a Washington Post op-ed.

"We are not waiting to act" while NTSB investigates what happened in East Palestine, and probing Norfolk Southern's safety culture overall, Shaw wrote.

"We are firmly committed to the residents of East Palestine and the surrounding communities in Ohio and Pennsylvania," Shaw continued. "Many of the people I've met are angry, scared and concerned about the future. I understand their skepticism that a big corporation such as Norfolk Southern will do the right thing, and we are determined to earn their trust."

While there is bipartisan concern about preventing future derailments involving hazardous materials, early in Thursday's hearing, it became clear there is a partisan divide in assessing how the Biden administration has responded to the Ohio incident. Carper, in his opening remarks, took time to thank the EPA for what he said was quick action.

"It's worth noting that the Biden administration has been on the ground from day one. As we will hear today, the EPA, working alongside state and local partners, arrived in East Palestine within hours after the derailment and has maintained a presence ever since. In fact, Administrator Regan has visited the area three times already," Carper said.

But Republican Sen. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia criticized the EPA for what she said was a lack of transparency that left citizens in East Palestine scared and confused.

"The public deserved a better level of transparency and much much sooner. A month after the accident it is clear to me that the EPA's risk communication strategy fell short in the immediate aftermath of the incident. Impacted communities were clamoring for answers," Capito said.

She said citizens of East Palestine were directed to generic EPA websites and left uncertain about what actions would be taken to protect them.

"Why did it take weeks for the EPA administrator to drink the water he repeatedly told residents was safe?" Capito questioned. "Why did it take almost a month to establish a response center and go door to door to East Palestine families concerned?

EPA Region 5 Administrator Debra Shore, another witness Thursday, acknowledged that East Palestine residents are “understandably worried and some are scared.”

“Every time a train whistle blows they're reminded of the trauma inflicted upon them by Norfolk Southern,” she said.

“While EPA is encouraged by the data, we also recognize that the people of East Palestine still question the health and safety of their community and their loved ones,” she said, pointing to the test results she says have still reflected that the air and water are okay-- a sentiment for which East Palestine residents audibly resisted from her at a town hall last week.

Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown testifies before a US Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works hearing on the environmental and public health threats from the Norfolk Southern February 3 train derailment, on March 9, 2023, in Washington, DC. ABC News

Ohio Sens. Sherrod Brown and JD Vance, who introduced bipartisan railroad safety legislation last week, appeared as witnesses, in addition to representatives from the EPA, Ohio EPA, Beaver County Department of Emergency Services and Ohio River Valley Water Sanitation Commission.

"If Norfolk Southern had paid a little more attention to safety, and a little less attention to its profits had cared a little more about the Ohioans along its tracks in a little less about its executives and shareholders, these accidents would not have been bad or maybe not happened at all," Brown, a Democrat, said Thursday. "It's Norfolk Southern's responsibility to keep its workers safe on the job. This company has failed to do its job, over and over and over."

Vance, a conservative Republican, said his party is facing a choice of whether to back a billion-dollar industry or the working class people he said the Republican Party has increasingly come to represent.

He spoke of working across the aisle with Democrats -- even bucking some members of his party -- to deliver effective rail safety legislation to benefit Ohio's working class.

"We are faced with a choice with this legislation and how we respond to this crisis. Do we do the bidding of a massive industry that is embedded with big government? Or do we do the bidding of the people who elected us to the Senate into the Congress in the first place?" he said.

Shaw did not commit specifically when asked if he'd support the proposed bipartisan Railway Safety Act, though noting that Norfolk Southern would commit to the “legislative intent to make rail safer.”

“We are committed to the legislative intent to make rail safer. Norfolk Southern runs a safe railroad and it's my commitment to improve that safety and make our safety culture the best in the industry. Just last year, derailments on Norfolk Southern were the lowest they had been in the last 10 years. And our personal injury rate is amongst the lowest in the industry,” he said.

The hearing comes on the heels of a second derailment on Saturday and after the National Transportation Safety Board announced Tuesday that it would launch a special investigation of Norfolk Southern's safety and culture. The last time the NTSB made such a move was in 2014, when it investigated Metro North for several significant accidents.

"Given the number and significance of recent Norfolk Southern accidents, the NTSB also urges the company to take immediate action today to review and assess its safety practices, with the input of employees and others, and implement necessary changes to improve safety," the NTSB said.

Earlier this week, Norfolk Southern also reported a fatal injury of one of their conductors -- in addition to several precious fatal accidents of their employees in recent years.Norfolk Southern CEO Alan Shaw faced a Senate grilling Thursday as Washington lawmakers held their first hearing on railroad safety about a month after a train carrying toxic chemicals derailed in East Palestine, Ohio.

Republican Perry Johnson kicked off his long shot 2024 presidential campaign amid the Conservative Political Action Conference last week less than a year after getting booted from the primary ballot in Michigan's gubernatorial race for invalid petition signatures.

Johnson took third in CPAC's straw poll for presidential picks, with nearly 5% of the vote. Though he polled behind former President Donald Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, he was ahead of former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and other well-known names like Trump Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul and Trump's vice president, Mike Pence.

While Johnson has no experience in elected office, he has a long career in business in Michigan. with almost 30 years of experience in the quality standards field. Two of his companies -- Perry Johnson Registrars, and Perry Johnson, Inc. -- both can certify businesses as meeting certain industry standards.

He has a bachelor's degree in mathematics from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, according to the Perry Johnson Foundation website.

Johnson lives in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan -- a Detroit suburb -- with his wife, Diana. He has three kids and is an "avid" bridge player, with five national championship wins, according to the Perry Johnson Foundation.

Before CPAC, his most notable political bid was when he ran for governor in Michigan in 2022 but was removed from the ballot before the Republican primary due to fraudulent and invalid petition signatures.

A review from the Michigan's Bureau of Elections led to him and four other GOP candidates being disqualified because the number of unusable signatures dropped them below the required 15,000 signatures.

Johnson filed 23,193 signatures, but the Bureau of Elections determined 9,393 were invalid.

The Bureau of Elections report breaks down the types of invalid signatures. Out of the signatures thrown out, 68 were from unregistered voters, 2,342 had insufficient information or information that didn't match, and 6,983 were signatures collected by fraudulent-petition circulators.

All five candidates dropped from the ballot had an overlap of the names of the fraudulent-petition circulators. Five names appeared on all five lists.

Out of the five dropped candidates, Johnson had the smallest number of invalid signatures. Republican Michael Brown had 13,809 total invalid signatures -– more than half of the nearly 21,000 filed.

Donna Brandenburg had 11,144 invalid signatures out of more than 17,500 filed.

Michael Markey had 17,374 invalid signatures out of 21,804 filed. Markey only had signatures discounted because of fraudulent-petition circulators.

James Craig had 11,113 invalid signatures out of more than 21,000 filed. Craig still ran as a write-in candidate for the Republican primary and snagged 3% of the vote.

Johnson filed a lawsuit against the state to get his name back on the ballot, but he lost the suit and an appeal to a state judge.

He filed his paperwork to run for president in 2024 nearly a month ago and spent six figures on a Super Bowl ad that ran in Iowa. The ad showed plus-sized versions of several Democratic congresspeople, calling them part of the "bloated" government.

The ad -- and part of Johnson's platform -- focuses on reducing federal spending by 2% each year. He recently published a book titled "Two Cents to Save America."

In his CPAC speech, he touted conservative talking points seen across the conference.

"I am pro-life, I am pro-Second Amendment, I am pro-freedom and, let's face it, I am anti-China," Johnson said. He went on to criticize the amount of aid the U.S. is sending Ukraine in its fight against Russia, though Johnson did say in his remarks he doesn't trust Vladimir Putin.Johnson was embroiled in a fraudulent signature scandal in Michigan last year.

The 2024 presidential race is already shaping up, with former President Donald Trump seeking to return to the White House and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley looking, as she has said, to mark a new generation of leaders.

Here's an updated list of who is running for president in 2024 and a brief look at the potential contenders who have not yet confirmed their plans -- as well as where President Joe Biden stands and those politicians who definitively ruled out a campaign.

Donald Trump, Republican

Trump, 76, formally launched his third bid for the White House on Nov. 15, following the 2022 midterms, which did not meet Republican expectations.

Trump announced his campaign from his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida. It didn't come as a surprise, given that Trump had been hinting for months that he would make a run.

"America's comeback starts right now," he said, describing the U.S. as "in decline" and touting his administration as a "golden age."

However, Trump's third run for the White House comes as he faces multiple investigations -- he denies wrongdoing -- and has become increasingly estranged from some other leading figures in the GOP in the wake of Jan. 6, his 2020 election lies and other controversies and scandals.

While polling shows he remains popular with many voters in the party, many others say they want another nominee.

"America's comeback starts right now," he insisted in his announcement speech.

Steve Laffey, Republican

The former mayor of Cranston, Rhode Island, Steve Laffey announced his candidacy for president on Feb. 2.

In a statement, he said he wanted to confront the country's issues.

"Our country has done the equivalent of using Band-Aids in place of major surgery. Somehow, we have 'gotten by,'" he said. "For the first time in a generation, we must directly confront our problems."

Laffey is a long-shot for the Oval Office, given his relative lack of name recognition or statewide or federal experience.

He previously made a run for Senate in 2006 in Rhode Island, against Republican Lincoln Chafee, who was ultimately defeated by Democrat Sheldon Whitehouse.

Nikki Haley, Republican

Haley, 51, announced her presidential bid in a video released on Feb. 14, a day ahead of a formal kickoff on Feb. 15 in Charleston.

Haley, who also served as a U.S. ambassador to the U.N. in the Trump administration, is the first high-profile Republican to challenge Trump.

In her announcement video, Haley, the daughter of immigrants, highlighted her heritage as a South Asian woman and touted her hopeful view of what America can offer.

"My mom would always say, 'Your job is not to focus on the differences but the similarities.' My parents reminded me and my siblings every day how blessed we were to live in America," Haley said.

She underscored her credentials as a former leader of the Palmetto State, stressing its resilience, but most of all she said there was major need for change in the GOP's candidates.

"Republicans have lost the popular vote in seven of the last eight presidential elections. … It's time for a new generation of leadership," she said.

Haley was elected as the first female governor of South Carolina in 2010, stepping down in 2017, during her second term, to serve as a Trump ambassador until 2018.

Vivek Ramaswamy, Republican

Ramaswamy, a 37-year-old multimillionaire entrepreneur who founded a major biotech company, announced on Feb. 21 that he is running for president as a Republican.

"We are in the middle of this national identity crisis, Tucker, where we have celebrated our diversity and our differences for so long that we forgot all the ways we're really just the same as Americans, bound by a common set of ideals that set this nation into motion 250 years ago," Ramaswamy told Fox News' Tucker Carlson.

When asked what his message to voters will be, Ramaswamy said that "we need to put merit back into America in every sphere of our lives" -- which includes immigration policy and affirmative action, the latter of which he argued was "a national cancer."

In a campaign video shared on Twitter, he said: "We still agree on our nation's most fundamental principles, at least most of us do. Yet the goal of the ruling party in this country is to convince us that we are divided."

The Indian-American entrepreneur is also the author of "Woke, Inc.: Inside Corporate America's Social Justice Scam."

A 75-year-old Michigan businessman, Johnson launched his presidential campaign for the 2024 Republican nomination amid the 2023 Conservative Political Action Conference that began on March 1.

Johnson took third in CPAC's straw poll for presidential picks, with nearly 5% of the vote. While he polled behind Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, he was ahead of Haley and others.

Before CPAC, his most notable political bid was when he ran for governor in Michigan in 2022 but was removed from the ballot before the Republican primary due to what state officials found to be fraudulent and invalid petition signatures.

Marianne Williamson, Democrat

Williamson, 70, first wrote in an email to donors on Feb. 26 that would will formally announce on March 4 that she is running for president as a Democrat, in a long shot primary challenge to Biden.

Williamson is a bestselling self-help book author who first ran for president in 2020 on a pacifist and progressive platform.

She dropped out of that race before any primaries were held, but she outlasted several other serious contenders with impressive electoral resumes, including now-Vice President Kamala Harris, who at the time was a senator from California.

Williamson has advocated for solving foreign conflicts without military intervention and embraced progressive platforms like so-called "Medicare for All" and a $15 minimum wage.

She also became a viral sensation for infusing her campaign with language from her career as an author, warning Trump in 2020 that "I’m going to harness love for political purposes. I will meet you on that field, and sir, love will win."

In her launch speech, Williamson focused on advocating for progressive policies, though she still included rhetoric reminiscent of her last campaign.

"We're all here because we care about this country. But we're all here, or at least many of us are, because we are upset about this country, we're worried about this country," she said, adding, "It is our job to create a vision of justice and love that is so powerful, that it will override the forces of hatred and injustice and fear."

Williamson also noted the conventional wisdom that she will face a nearly impossible task of unseating Biden in a primary, casting herself as a fighter against the establishment.

"I'm not naive about the forces which have no intention of allowing anyone into this conversation who does not align with their predetermined agenda," she said.

Where President Joe Biden stands on reelection bid

Biden, 80, has repeatedly said he intends to run for reelection in 2024 barring some major issue such as his health. However, the Democrat has not officially announced a decision.

"[M]y intention has been from the beginning to run. But there's too many other things we have to finish in the near term before I start a campaign," he told ABC News anchor David Muir at the White House in February.

Biden told Muir in December 2021 that the possibility of a rematch with Trump wouldn't dissuade him.

"Why would I not run against Donald Trump for the nominee? That'll increase the prospect of running," he said.

A look at potential presidential candidates

Observers say the list of other potential White House hopefuls includes Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who has played down questions about his ambitions, as well as New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott and others.

DeSantis has said for the time being he's focused on serving as governor of Florida, an office he was just reelected to by a mammoth 19-point margin. And while the speculation over potential White House aspirations has reached a boiling point, an announcement would likely not come before Florida's state legislative session is over in the summer.

Sununu, meanwhile, has been open that he's mulling a White House run, saying on ABC's "This Week" in February that he's "definitely thinking about it and having those conversations."

Scott has been more mum on his possible aspirations, though he has traveled to early primary states like Iowa, New Hampshire and his home state of South Carolina and is scheduled to participate in a presidential candidate forum next month.

Another possible entrant is former Vice President Mike Pence, who broke with Trump over his ability to overturn the 2020 election results. Pence told ABC News' David Muir last year that he was thinking about a bid and has been traveling to early primary states with a message focused largely on social issues.

"I wish her well. Ambassador Nikki Haley did a great job in our administration, and she may have more company soon in the race for president, and I promise folks here in Iowa and all of you I'll keep you posted," he teased on Feb. 15 when asked about Haley's announcement.

Other possible contenders could be former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who have said they're actively considering running.

Who isn't running

Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan on March 5 became the first major Republican mulling a presidential bid to say he will not run in 2024.

Hogan said in a statement that he would not "risk being part of another multicar pileup that could potentially help Mr. Trump recapture the nomination," as Trump did in 2016 when he won the GOP nomination amid a splintered field.

ABC News' Tal Axelrod, Hannah Demissie, Oren Oppenheim, Brittany Shepherd and Leah Vredenbregt contributed to this report.The list of candidates includes Nikki Haley, Donald Trump and more.

The 2024 presidential race is already shaping up, with former President Donald Trump seeking to return to the White House and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley looking, as she has said, to mark a new generation of leaders.

Here's an updated list of who is running for president in 2024 and a brief look at the potential contenders who have not yet confirmed their plans -- as well as where President Joe Biden stands and those politicians who definitively ruled out a campaign.

Donald Trump, Republican

Trump, 76, formally launched his third bid for the White House on Nov. 15, following the 2022 midterms, which did not meet Republican expectations.

Trump announced his campaign from his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida. It didn't come as a surprise, given that Trump had been hinting for months that he would make a run.

"America's comeback starts right now," he said, describing the U.S. as "in decline" and touting his administration as a "golden age."

However, Trump's third run for the White House comes as he faces multiple investigations -- he denies wrongdoing -- and has become increasingly estranged from some other leading figures in the GOP in the wake of Jan. 6, his 2020 election lies and other controversies and scandals.

While polling shows he remains popular with many voters in the party, many others say they want another nominee.

"America's comeback starts right now," he insisted in his announcement speech.

Steve Laffey, Republican

The former mayor of Cranston, Rhode Island, Steve Laffey announced his candidacy for president on Feb. 2.

In a statement, he said he wanted to confront the country's issues.

"Our country has done the equivalent of using Band-Aids in place of major surgery. Somehow, we have 'gotten by,'" he said. "For the first time in a generation, we must directly confront our problems."

Laffey is a long-shot for the Oval Office, given his relative lack of name recognition or statewide or federal experience.

He previously made a run for Senate in 2006 in Rhode Island, against Republican Lincoln Chafee, who was ultimately defeated by Democrat Sheldon Whitehouse.

Nikki Haley, Republican

Haley, 51, announced her presidential bid in a video released on Feb. 14, a day ahead of a formal kickoff on Feb. 15 in Charleston.

Haley, who also served as a U.S. ambassador to the U.N. in the Trump administration, is the first high-profile Republican to challenge Trump.

In her announcement video, Haley, the daughter of immigrants, highlighted her heritage as a South Asian woman and touted her hopeful view of what America can offer.

"My mom would always say, 'Your job is not to focus on the differences but the similarities.' My parents reminded me and my siblings every day how blessed we were to live in America," Haley said.

She underscored her credentials as a former leader of the Palmetto State, stressing its resilience, but most of all she said there was major need for change in the GOP's candidates.

"Republicans have lost the popular vote in seven of the last eight presidential elections. … It's time for a new generation of leadership," she said.

Haley was elected as the first female governor of South Carolina in 2010, stepping down in 2017, during her second term, to serve as a Trump ambassador until 2018.

Vivek Ramaswamy, Republican

Ramaswamy, a 37-year-old multimillionaire entrepreneur who founded a major biotech company, announced on Feb. 21 that he is running for president as a Republican.

"We are in the middle of this national identity crisis, Tucker, where we have celebrated our diversity and our differences for so long that we forgot all the ways we're really just the same as Americans, bound by a common set of ideals that set this nation into motion 250 years ago," Ramaswamy told Fox News' Tucker Carlson.

When asked what his message to voters will be, Ramaswamy said that "we need to put merit back into America in every sphere of our lives" -- which includes immigration policy and affirmative action, the latter of which he argued was "a national cancer."

In a campaign video shared on Twitter, he said: "We still agree on our nation's most fundamental principles, at least most of us do. Yet the goal of the ruling party in this country is to convince us that we are divided."

The Indian-American entrepreneur is also the author of "Woke, Inc.: Inside Corporate America's Social Justice Scam."

Perry Johnson, Republican

A 75-year-old Michigan businessman, Johnson launched his presidential campaign for the 2024 Republican nomination amid the 2023 Conservative Political Action Conference that began on March 1.

Johnson took third in CPAC's straw poll for presidential picks, with nearly 5% of the vote. While he polled behind Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, he was ahead of Haley and others.

While Johnson has no experience in elected office, he has a long career in business in Michigan. with almost 30 years of experience in the quality standards field. Two of his companies -- Perry Johnson Registrars, and Perry Johnson, Inc. -- both can certify businesses as meeting certain industry standards.

Before CPAC, his most notable political bid was when he ran for governor in Michigan in 2022 but was removed from the ballot before the Republican primary due to what state officials found to be fraudulent and invalid petition signatures.

The House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic, chaired by Ohio Republican Brad Wenstrup, met to tackle a question that's plagued intelligence and health officials for the past three years: Where did the virus that has killed more than 1 million Americans and nearly 7 million people worldwide come from?

The two prevailing theories are a leak from a laboratory in China, which the Chinese government vehemently disputes, or humans being exposed to an infected animal.

All of the witnesses who appeared before the panel agreed: The origin of COVID-19 is important to protect the world from future pandemics.

They also agreed that it will be difficult to know the truth without greater cooperation from the Chinese government.

As Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines noted Wednesday morning at a separate Senate hearing on global threats, there is "broad consensus" that the virus did not emerge as a bioweapon -- but there is no such agreement on whether it came from an accidental lab leak or natural spillover.

Dr. Robert Redfield, who served as director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention under former President Donald Trump, doubled down in his testimony in the House that the "more likely" origin of COVID-19 was from an "accidental lab leak" as opposed to jumping to humans from animals.

Still, he said, "From the earliest days of the pandemic, my view was both theories about the origin needed to be aggressively and thoroughly examined."

Redfield also said he believes the answer to COVID-19's origin likely lies with the intelligence community, not with scientists.

When asked about an upcoming House vote to require the Biden administration to declassify intelligence related to the origins of COVID-19 -- especially if there is "reason to believe" the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China may have been involved -- Redfield said he supported it, with the exception of protecting sources and methods.

Both retired Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top COVID-19 official under Trump and President Joe Biden, and former National Institutes of Health Director Francis Collins have said that they believe the virus most likely originated in nature. But they have directly called for more research and collaboration with China on lab leak theories as well.

As he and others have previously said, Redfield testified that he believes in the lab leak theory because COVID-19's structure looks "engineered" and in line with controversial gain-of-function research on viral genes, in addition to the "unusual actions in and around Wuhan in the fall of 2019."

Other scientists have refuted the idea that the virus was tweaked or altered in a laboratory setting, saying a genetic analysis suggests it evolved in nature.

Redfield suggested before the House subcommittee that he had been sidelined from early scientific discussions, including within the government, because he didn't agree with the preliminary consensus on where COVID-19 came from.

"This was a narrative that was decided, that they were going to say this came from a wet market, and they were going to do everything they could to support it -- to negate any discussion about the possibility that this came from a laboratory," he asserted.

Fauci, who was not at the hearing, later dismissed Redfield's accusation as "completely untrue."

"No one excluded anyone," he told Politico. (ABC News has reached out to him for comment.)

U.S. agencies have said they remain "divided" on the matter and with no "smoking gun" and limited access to raw data, including via cooperation from China, discussion of the science has played out in a haze of circumstantial evidence.

Witnesses at Wednesday's hearing also included Dr. Paul Auwaerter, a professor of medicine at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, and Jamie Metzl, a former adviser to the World Health Organization and former national security official in the Clinton administration.

Metzl, in his testimony, said that "understanding how this pandemic began is essential to prioritizing our response" going forward and will help gear future oversight and attention to new threats.

"If, for example, we knew for certain the pandemic stems from a lab incident in Wuhan [in China], I can assure you that efforts to regulate the rapid proliferation of high-containment, and all too often high-risk, virology labs across the globe would get a massive boost," Metzl said. "Critically important biosafety efforts would finally get the high-level national and international attention they deserve."

"Understanding how this crisis began and determining how we can do better is and must be the ultimate bipartisan and nonpartisan issue," Metzl said, urging pressure on and "demanding accountability from" Beijing.

Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images

"Doing so is not a hostile act, but the opposite," Metzl said. "Supporting and joining a full and unfettered investigation has always been the best way for the Chinese government to demonstrate its commitment to understanding what went wrong."

Metzl's call for bipartisanship was echoed by lawmakers.

"I think you will see a strong bipartisan vote encouraging the intelligence community to declassify as much information as possible so the public can see the information that we have," Rep. Ami Bera, D-Calif., said.

Republicans kept up a focus on Fauci, who has long been the target of conservative criticism and some right-wing conspiracies about how COVID-19 was created.

Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks of Iowa blamed "suppression and obfuscation" by Fauci and others, which "has led to the exact mistrust and distrust and conspiracy theories that they tried to avoid."

Rep. James Comer of Kentucky, who is also the chair of the House Oversight Committee, more directly tried to link Fauci and Collins with allegedly being involved in the virus being developed in a lab -- a claim without evidence.

China, for its part, has insisted it wants to find the truth even as it has been criticized for not complying with international investigations.

Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Zhao Lijian previously said in a statement, "Origins tracing is a matter of science. China always supports and will continue to participate in the science-based origins study."

According to reporting in The Wall Street Journal last week, the U.S. Energy Department, which oversees a network of labs, said it now believes COVID-19 "most likely" was the result of a leak from a lab -- an assessment in line with that of the FBI.

"The FBI has for quite some time now assessed that the origins of the pandemic are most likely a potential lab incident in Wuhan," FBI Director Chris Wray said in response to the Energy Department's evaluation, which the Journal wrote was made with "low confidence," citing people who read the report.

Four other U.S. agencies, however, believe the virus was a result of natural transmission and that it jumped from animals to humans at a wet market. Two other agencies are undecided as to how it started.

"There's just no consensus across the government. The work continues," White House spokesperson John Kirby told reporters last week.

At Wednesday's hearing, Redfield told the subcommittee members: "We need to get the intelligence community -- and you will have the way to do that -- I'd like to have you have each of them show what data they have, where they got it, who their informants were and what their conclusions were."

"Because as you know, a number of them are on the fence. They don't say yes or no," Redfield said, referencing the FBI and Department of Energy's belief that a lab leak is more likely, with varying degrees of low and moderate confidence. Redfield said the two agencies have the "strongest scientific footprint of any of our intelligence agencies."

Experts have said that, regardless of the number of hearings, successful investigation of COVID-19's origins will almost certainly require fuller cooperation from the Chinese government. Looking into how outbreaks began takes extensive, on-the-ground scientific work.

Congressional Republicans have set their sights on investigating the origins of the virus, with House Republicans launching a probe not long after taking back majority control of the chamber.

A group of GOP senators are also now demanding to see the individual assessments on COVID-19 origins from each of the U.S. agencies.

"Congress should be able to review the independent evaluations without filters, ambiguity or interpretations of the intelligence," a group of Republican senators, led by Kansas' Roger Marshall, wrote in a letter sent Monday to Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines, who is set to separately appear this week before members of Congress' intelligence committees.

"The ODNI has failed to be transparent with Congress and the American people by standardizing agency conclusions and thereby ignoring the breadth of scientific and other expertise in each agency," the senators wrote.

"The ODNI has failed to be transparent with Congress and the American people by standardizing agency conclusions and thereby ignoring the breadth of scientific and other expertise in each agency," the senators wrote.

ABC News' Mary Kekatos and Sony Salzman contributed to this report.Republicans on the House Oversight Committee said Wednesday they are planning a visit with some defendants who are being held in connection with the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.

House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer of Kentucky and Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who also sits on the panel, told ABC News that the committee is planning to send a letter this week to lawmakers regarding the planned visit to the Washington, D.C., detention facility.

Greene said the visit would focus on the conditions of those jailed over Jan. 6, including what she claimed to be "reports of abuse."

"They're pretrial and they haven't even been convicted and they're not allowed to see their families, many times are not allowed to see their attorneys -- the food has been a major complaint," Greene alleged. "There's been complaints of it tasting like cleaner."

The vast majority of defendants charged in connection with Jan. 6 have not been ordered to be detained pending trial, but in the several dozen cases where individuals have been held, a judge has determined that there's no combination of conditions that could be placed on them to ensure that they either wouldn't pose a danger to the general public or risk obstructing justice in their case.

"As of today, approximately two dozen defendants, charged in the Capitol breach, are being held in pretrial detention," a spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney's Office in D.C. told ABC News. "Almost all of those detainees are charged with assaultive conduct and none are charged with a misdemeanor."

In late 2021, the U.S. Marshals Service conducted an inspection of the D.C. jail's Central Detention Facility – a separate facility from where the Jan. 6 defendants have been detained -- and said they would relocate roughly 400 inmates to a separate jail in Pennsylvania after finding the conditions there did not meet minimum federal standards.

An inspection of the facility holding the Jan. 6 defendants, however, "did not identify conditions that would necessitate the transfer of inmates," the Marshals Service said in 2021.

Greene has previously visited some Jan. 6 defendants in jail where she saw they were "suffering greatly," she said in 2021.

She was criticized in December for what she said was a "sarcastic joke" about the riot at the Capitol: "If Steve Bannon and I had organized that, we would have won. ... Not to mention, it would've been armed."

She said Wednesday that the jail visit would be open to members outside of the Oversight Committee but that a date has not been confirmed.

"We're gonna try and see what it looks like … that's part of what the Oversight Committee does with everything pertaining to the federal government, so we have some members that are going to hopefully tour that prison," Comer told reporters.

The Oversight Committee's ranking Democratic member, Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, responded to the planned visit in a statement to ABC News, saying, "The treatment of detained individuals in facilities across the country is an important subject for Congressional oversight. That's why last Congress Oversight Democrats pressed for answers on the deteriorating conditions at Rikers Island in New York, for example."

"Our GOP colleagues' sudden and selective sympathy for January 6 insurrectionists reflects their continuing effort to lionize the violent attempt to overthrow the 2020 presidential election," Raskin contended.

News of the jail trip comes as House Speaker Kevin McCarthy faces bipartisan backlash over exclusively sharing security footage from Jan. 6 with Fox News' Tucker Carlson, who used the clips to try and downplay the Capitol attack -- drawing a rebuke from the Capitol Police chief. McCarthy said Tuesday he released the video in the interest of "transparency."

The Department of Justice said earlier this week that at least 1,000 people have been charged in connection with the Capitol assault, which sent lawmakers briefly into hiding.

The Senate voted 81-14, with Georgia Democrat Raphael Warnock voting present, to shut down the proposed changes. Thirty-three members of the Democratic caucus voted along with Republicans.

"It’s the opposite of good policy. It will make the crime wave even worse. It sends the wrong message that D.C. isn’t serious about violent crime," the resolution's lead sponsor, Tennessee Republican Sen. Bill Hagerty, said on the floor.

However, he told reporters, he was "open" to working with the city council to continue to update the criminal code.

"Most Americans from all over the country visit our nation’s capital each week to meet with their federal representatives and to enjoy our national history," Hagerty said. "Congress has a constitutional obligation to make sure these visitors can walk down the sidewalk or enjoy a meal without fear of becoming victims."

The new code would have reduced maximum penalties for burglary, carjacking, robbery and other offenses while increasing sentences for crimes including attempted murder. It would have also eliminated some mandatory minimum sentences for some crimes and would have expanded jury trials for certain misdemeanors.

The district's city council initially passed the changes by a 13-0 margin, though Mayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat, vetoed it. Her veto was overturned by a 12-1 vote, sending the legislation to the House.

Because of the district's unique status, Congress has authority over its laws.

In the House, Republicans led a resolution to shut down the effort and were joined by 31 Democrats. After that February vote, President Biden said he would sign the GOP legislation, opening the floodgates for Senate Democrats to say they too supported stopping the changes to the criminal code.

The GOP-led measure to block the reforms from taking place sparked broad debate over Democrats' messaging on crime, the best way to ensure public safety and how much autonomy the nation's capital should have, with many Democrats -- including Biden -- having called for it to be a state.

Advocates of the new criminal code said the city deserves to be allowed to govern itself, noting that no Washington law has been overturned by Congress in three decades.

Supporters also cited how long the revisions were developed for a criminal code that hasn't been updated to this degree in more than a century.

"The elected representatives of the District of Columbia, after exhaustive review made some decisions about criminal justice reform. I don't agree with every single one of them they made, but I'll tell you this: What they did is entirely defensible, and it certainly doesn't rise to the level of the United States Congress for the first time in 30 years big-footing their decisions," Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., said Wednesday.

"Think about how patronizing and paternalistic for this body not being any part of this process now suddenly saying they need adult supervision as if they are children," added Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., who was raised in D.C.

Activists outside the Capitol rallied to push lawmakers to shut down the effort to scrap the changes, but to no avail.

Seventeen people were arrested, according to Capitol Police, including local elected officials who are members of the Advisory Neighborhood Commission and advocacy organization leaders. At least 16 people were arrested for allegedly crowding, obstructing and incommoding another person and one was arrested for alleged defacement during a planned act of civil disobedience.

"We have come together today with one simple message for Congress, and President Biden. Keep your hands off D.C. You either support D.C. home rule or you don’t. There are no exceptions. And there is no middle ground on D.C.’s rights to self-government," Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton, Washington's only representative in Congress and who doesn't get to vote on legislation, said at a protest.

Still, it was not enough to blunt the support for the legislation, particularly after Biden and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, N.Y., said they supported it.

"I'm going to vote yes. It was a close question. But on the balance, I'm voting yes," Schumer said Tuesday.

The White House defended Biden's backing as a sign of his support for anti-crime efforts despite also endorsing home rule for the district.

"That includes D.C."During their first hearing investigating the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, Republicans on the House Foreign Affairs Committee sought Wednesday to evoke memories of the frenzied final days of the occupation, relying on emotional testimony from veterans who witnessed the evacuations and a deadly explosion outside of Kabul's airport that killed 13 American service members along with scores of Afghans.

One of the witnesses at the hearing, Sgt. Tyler Vargas-Andrews, was badly injured by that blast -- a suicide bombing carried out by the terrorist organization known as the Islamic State in Khorasan Province, or ISIS-K.

Through tears, Vargas-Andrews described in poignant detail the moment he was thrown 12 feet by "a massive wave of pressure."

"I opened my eyes to Marines -- dead or unconscious -- lying around me," he said. "A crowd of hundreds vanished in front of me, and my body was catastrophically wounded."

Vargas-Andrews lost an arm and a leg in the explosion, but much of his testimony focused on the hours leading up to the attack -- the moments when he believes he and his fellow Marines could have stopped it from ever happening. He testified that on Aug. 26, 2021, the day of the attack, the military had intelligence that a suicide bomber traveling with a companion intended to strike Abbey Gate, the entrance to the airport, as well as a description of their physical appearances.

His team spotted two men matching that description who were "consistently and nervously looking up at our position through the crowd," Vargas-Andrews said, adding that the older of the two appeared to be coaching the younger one.

Although they sent photos to their higher ups and asked for permission to shoot them, Vargas-Andrews said the only answer they received from their battalion commander was "I don't know."

Shortly after, the blast came.

While tacticians and other experts might debate the merits of pulling the trigger on an unconfirmed target, Chairman Michael McCaul, R-Texas, argued that the lack of clear answer from Vargas-Andrews' superiors at the time was indicative of a broader issue -- the Biden's administration's disorder.

In his opening statement on Wednesday, McCaul accused diplomats and the White House of ignoring grim intelligence assessments depicting the realities on the ground in Afghanistan as the Taliban crept closer to Kabul, eventually overtaking the city in August 2021. At the time, the final American troops were preparing to leave the country as part of what the president said then was a necessary if difficult end to a historically long conflict that had stretched far beyond its goal, costing too much in lives and money.

But in McCaul's view on Wednesday, "We simply weren't ready" to leave.

Another veteran, former Army Spc. Aidan Gunderson, spoke to the lack of preparedness. He recalled embarking on a rapid deployment to help secure the Kabul airport in 2021 while evacuations of American citizens and allies were underway, saying the only food they had was whatever they happened to stash in their rucksacks before departing the U.S.

"Not a single person on that plane was prepared for Kabul," Gunderson said of his unit's crossing into Afghanistan. "To say supplies were scarce is an understatement."

Gunderson said that immediately upon landing in Kabul, the disorder and desperation was apparent. He vividly described seeing the airport swarmed with Afghans trying to flee and completely encircled by heavily armed Taliban fighters, who were permitting the withdrawal.

He also recalled the remains of those who had been so desperate to escape that they tried clinging to the landing gear of a plane as it took off.

"At this moment, I truly understood that the Afghans were risking everything -- even death -- to escape the Taliban," he said, choking up. "I see the faces of all the people we cannot save -- all those we left behind."

Retired Army Special Forces Lt. Col. David Scott Mann, another witness, spoke to the trauma inflicted on the veteran community by the withdrawal, predicting the U.S. was on the "front end of a mental health tsunami."

"We might be done with Afghanistan, but it's not done with us," he said.

In a statement after the hearing, White House spokesman Ian Sams pointed to Trump administration failures in Afghanistan, including a deal with the Taliban, and insisted that "instead of returning the U.S. to active combat with the Taliban and putting even more of our troops’ lives at risk, President Biden made the tough decision to finally end the 20-year war in Afghanistan, bring our troops home, and safely evacuate tens upon tens of thousands of Americans and Afghan allies."

"As a result, we are no longer losing American lives and spending tens of billions of dollars a year fighting a war with no end in sight," Sams said.

Likewise, although Democrats listened attentively to the witnesses at the hearing and expressed a desire to learn from mistakes made throughout the decades-long war, some of them accused Republicans of putting on a partisan show and unfairly pinning the blame solely on the Biden administration.

"Today's hearing should be focused on examining the full scope of this conflict -- its failures and its successes," said Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I. "I fear, however, that today's hearing was not convened in that spirit but rather as an attempt to distract us from the full picture and even in some cases to try and score political points, which I believe dishonors the lives lost and the bravery of those who sit in front of this committee."

Republicans disagreed.

Pennsylvania Rep. Scott Perry accused Democrats in turn of attempting to avoid accountability and called for a full hearing with "the folks at the top" -- the secretaries of defense and state, as well as the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

As the Biden administration prepares for the possible end of the immigration restriction known as Title 42 -- which could lead to an increase of people attempting to cross the southern border -- sources say government officials are weighing whether to detain migrant families who illegally enter the country, a politically fraught move on an issue that invites near-constant scrutiny.

The deliberations about potentially detaining migrant families, which the Biden administration stopped doing in 2021, were confirmed by sources familiar with the matter.

One source, who declined to be named in order to discuss internal policy deliberations, stressed that no decisions have been made and the conversations about migrant family detention have been limited in scope and focused on the short period of time needed for swift processing.

The detentions, under U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, would be limited to a small number of days, another source told ABC News -- unlike during the Trump administration, which tried to detain families indefinitely.

The sources also insisted that processing for those detained would comply with federal standards, including a 20-day cap on the amount of time they are held.

The administration has, more broadly, taken steps in recent months to speed up its processing of detained migrants.

But the possible return to detaining migrants families quickly ignited political blowback from key members of President Joe Biden's party.

"I'm alarmed by news reports that the Administration is considering reinstating family detention policies," Rep. Bennie Thompson, the top Democrat on the House Homeland Security Committee, said Tuesday. "If the reports are true, I strongly urge the Administration to reconsider this policy change and instead work towards implementing immigration policies that are humane, orderly, and in line with our American values."

Rep. Nanette Barragán, the chairwoman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, called reports that the Biden administration is considering detaining migrant families "deeply concerning."

"A just, safe, and humane immigration system should not place families in detention," Barragán said, in part, in a statement. "We should not return to the failed policies of the past where families are detained in substandard conditions with long term damage to children."

White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Tuesday declined to comment on the possibility that the administration could go back to detaining migrant families while not ruling it out either.

"I'm not saying it is being considered ... and I'm not saying it is not," Jean-Pierre said. "I'm saying that I'm not going to speak to rumors,"

When asked why Biden might consider detaining migrant families, given he stopped the policy shortly after taking office, Jean-Pierre again punted.

"He is going to use the tools that he has before him to make sure that we deal with an immigration system, where we build an immigration system that's again, safe, orderly and humane," she said.

The administration has continued to prepare for the end of the public health order known as Title 42, which restricts immigration during the COVID-19 pandemic.

A federal judge initially ruled the restriction had to lift by December, finding it "arbitrary and capricious," with minimal public health impact. But 19 largely Republican-led states appealed and the matter is now pending before the U.S. Supreme Court.

Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Luis Miranda reiterated in a statement this week that while "no decisions have been made" about family detention, "The Administration will continue to prioritize safe, orderly, and humane processing of migrants."

Republican state leaders like Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and GOP lawmakers in Washington have argued that the president's policies are "reckless" and expose the U.S. to too much harm from immigration -- including as a burden on government resources and via the flow of deadly narcotics.

Conservatives often cite record numbers of border crossings over the past year.

Recently the administration has taken steps to crack down on unauthorized migration while opening new, limited avenues for humanitarian relief for those fleeing violence and persecution.

Parole programs allowing Cuban, Haitian, Nicaraguan and Venezuelan migrants to apply for entry from abroad have been paired with new restrictions that allow authorities to return migrants from those countries back to Mexico.

The administration is also currently working to implement a new rule to bar entry for migrants who cross illegally, seeking asylum, without first seeking refuge elsewhere.

But the administration has been under fire from both Republicans, who have fought the humanitarian pathways in court, and from Democrats concerned about turning away migrants with legitimate claims.

Immigrant advocates said this week that the administration considering again detaining families along with some of the other recent proposals were an embrace of Trump-like policies and a reversal of campaign promises from Biden.

"Children should be released from ICE detention with their parents immediately. This is pretty simple, and I can't believe I have to say it: Families belong together," then-candidate Biden tweeted in 2020.

The American Civil Liberties Union, which has levied legal challenges against family detention by other administrations, said it will consider fighting any attempt by Biden to implement similar policies.

"If President Biden moves forward with these plans, he will be putting vulnerable, traumatized immigrant children at risk. We will fight him every step of the way," ACLU Executive Director Anthony Romero said.

The Immigration Hub's Executive Director Sergio Gonzales said family detention would not deter migrants rom seeking asylum in the U.S. and may also prompt people to separate out of fear that their children would be detained.

"There's no credible research that I have seen that has shown that when you jail families, it actually stops people from coming to our border," Gonzales told ABC News. "They're literally fleeing for their lives when they come to our border. They believe they have no other choice."

In 2018, Drs. Scott Allen and Pamela McPherson, two subject matter experts in medical and mental health who work with the DHS' Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, raised alarm to DHS and Congress about the dangers family detention poses for children.

On Tuesday, the doctors sent a letter to President Biden and Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas warning the same.

"No amount of programming can ameliorate the harms created by the very act of confining children to detention centers," they wrote.A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said no decisions have been made.

As the Biden administration prepares for the possible end of the immigration restriction known as Title 42 -- which could lead to an increase of people attempting to cross the southern border -- sources say government officials are weighing whether to detain migrant families who illegally enter the country, a politically fraught move on an issue that invites near-constant scrutiny.

The deliberations about potentially detaining migrant families, which the Biden administration stopped doing in 2021, were confirmed by sources familiar with the matter.

One source, who declined to be named in order to discuss internal policy deliberations, stressed that no decisions have been made and the conversations about migrant family detention have been limited in scope and focused on the short period of time needed for swift processing.

The detentions, under U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, would be limited to a small number of days, another source told ABC News -- unlike during the Trump administration, which tried to detain families indefinitely.

The sources also insisted that processing for those detained would comply with federal standards, including a 20-day cap on the amount of time they are held.

The administration has, more broadly, taken steps in recent months to speed up its processing of detained migrants.

But the possible return to detaining migrants families quickly ignited political blowback from key members of President Joe Biden's party.

"I'm alarmed by news reports that the Administration is considering reinstating family detention policies," Rep. Bennie Thompson, the top Democrat on the House Homeland Security Committee, said Tuesday. "If the reports are true, I strongly urge the Administration to reconsider this policy change and instead work towards implementing immigration policies that are humane, orderly, and in line with our American values."

Rep. Nanette Barragán, the chairwoman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, called reports that the Biden administration is considering detaining migrant families "deeply concerning."

"A just, safe, and humane immigration system should not place families in detention," Barragán said, in part, in a statement. "We should not return to the failed policies of the past where families are detained in substandard conditions with long term damage to children."

White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Tuesday declined to comment on the possibility that the administration could go back to detaining migrant families while not ruling it out either.

"I'm not saying it is being considered ... and I'm not saying it is not," Jean-Pierre said. "I'm saying that I'm not going to speak to rumors,"

When asked why Biden might consider detaining migrant families, given he stopped the policy shortly after taking office, Jean-Pierre again punted.

"He is going to use the tools that he has before him to make sure that we deal with an immigration system, where we build an immigration system that's again, safe, orderly and humane," she said.

The administration has continued to prepare for the end of the public health order known as Title 42, which restricts immigration during the COVID-19 pandemic.

A federal judge initially ruled the restriction had to lift by December, finding it "arbitrary and capricious," with minimal public health impact. But 19 largely Republican-led states appealed and the matter is now pending before the U.S. Supreme Court.

Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Luis Miranda reiterated in a statement this week that while "no decisions have been made" about family detention, "The Administration will continue to prioritize safe, orderly, and humane processing of migrants."

Republican state leaders like Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and GOP lawmakers in Washington have argued that the president's policies are "reckless" and expose the U.S. to too much harm from immigration -- including as a burden on government resources and via the flow of deadly narcotics.

First lady Jill Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Wednesday hosted the 17th annual International Women of Courage Awards -- and for the first time, the ceremony took place at the White House, on "the biggest stage we could," Biden said.

The pair honored 11 global women leaders -- some from countries embroiled in crisis -- to mark International Women's Day and recognize those with "exceptional courage, strength, and leadership in advocating for peace, justice, human rights, gender equity and equality, often at great personal risk and sacrifice." Since 2007, the State Department has given out the courage awards to more than 180 women from more than 80 countries.

"Today, we're here to tell girls everywhere the truth that they need to hear: Yes, you matter. Yes, you can make a difference," Biden said at the White House's East Room.

"That's why we wanted to bring the leaders we're honoring today, and the stories that they share, to the biggest stage we could: The White House. And, Tony, thank you for helping us do that," she said.

The 2023 event honored Yuliia "Taira" Paievska, who led a volunteer unit of paramedics in Ukraine and spent three months in Russian captivity after getting detained in Mariupol for attempting to evacuate women and children in the wake of Russia's invasion.

Earlier on Wednesday, the White House released a statement from President Joe Biden to mark the day. He noted the gender abuses in conflict-ridden countries like Afghanistan and Ukraine.

"Despite decades of progress, in far too many places around the world, the rights of women and girls are still under attack, holding back entire communities," he said.

"We see it in Afghanistan, where the Taliban bars women and girls from attending school and pursuing employment. We see it in Iran, where the regime is brutally repressing the voices of women who are courageously standing up for their freedom. And in the face of Russia's vicious and unjust invasion of Ukraine, including the use of rape as a weapon of war, we see countless stories of women bravely fighting for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all Ukrainians," he continued.

At Wednesday's ceremony, Jill Biden applauded Blinken's leadership in addressing foreign crises like in Ukraine, and Blinken highlighted the administration's work to push forward gender equality abroad.

"President Biden has made gender equality and women's rights a priority of our foreign policy," Blinken remarked, nodding to the creation of the "first ever" cross-government strategy on women's global economic security, a gender policy council and updated strategies to respond to gender-based violence globally, including new efforts to expand access to programs for historically marginalized communities.

Other honorees at the courage awards included independent Ethiopian journalist Meaza Mohammed, who has been covering gender-focused violence in the country; Zakira Hekmat, an Afghan doctor and advocate who grew up and was secretly educated under Taliban rule; and Doris Ríos, an indigenous rights leader from Costa Rica, among others.

The Madeleine Albright Honorary Group Award went to the women and girl protestors of Iran who embarked on months of grassroots demonstrations across Iran's 31 provinces following the suspicious death of Mahsa Amini, the 22-year-old Iranian woman taken into custody for allegedly improperly wearing a hijab.

"Women in all of their diversity are often the ones on the front lines of change. And yet at the same time, they face still greater obstacles to their political participation," Blinken said Wednesday.

"Defending the rights of women and girls is rooted in our democratic values of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all," he said.

Earlier on Wednesday, the State Department marked International Women's Day by announcing coordinated action with its allies intended to "to promote accountability for the Iranian regime's human rights abuses," particularly against women and girls in the wake of the death of Amini.

Blinken announced sanctions against two Iranian officials overseeing prisons in Iran which he alleged were complicit in the gross mistreatment of prisoners, two senior Iranian security leaders who he said ordered the detention and torture of protestors, three companies that supply Iranian law enforcement & their CEOS, and another high-ranking law enforcement officer in the country for imposing censorship policies.

Jill Biden closed her Wednesday remarks with a call for accountability of men to uphold gender-based freedoms.

"As much as we need women who are willing to speak up, we need more men who are willing to listen and act," she said.

"We need more men to hold each other accountable when their sisters are being hurt or left behind. We need more men who nurture families, who feed and teach and mentor, who build safer communities. We need more men who know that caring, collaboration, and kindness are signs of strength, not weakness."

ABC News' Shannon Crawford contributed to this report.Some of the tools can accomplish "in less than a minute" what had taken days.

The Biden administration is moving to implement a new national security strategy focused on stopping hackers, as buzz around artificial intelligence tools raises concern among some experts that criminals may try to exploit AI capabilities.

One aim of the administration strategy is to shift the focus of blame away from the victims of cybercrime, U.S. security officials said. After-the-fact assessments often focus on the target for being vulnerable enough to hack -- but if that target is a rural hospital, for example, limitations might exists on what that hospital can do to protect against bad actors, especially those backed by foreign governments.

Instead, the new plan focuses on strengthening the public-private partnerships that encourage security firms to share what they know about hacker networks in order to bring them to justice.

Emerging technology will test the viability of the strategy going forward, experts told ABC News, especially with AI posing new security challenges.

The same advantages seen in AI tools like ChatGPT from research lab OpenAI, which formulates human-like responses to questions posed by a user, are vulnerable to nefarious use, according to Ari Jacoby, a tech executive who has focused on using AI to fight fraud.

Given the volumes of publicly available information on software engineering, hackers could use the chat bots to generate or enhance malicious computer code, Jacoby said.

According to OpenAI's user policy, using ChatGPT to write malware, generate hateful or harmful content or engage in fraudulent activity is explicitly prohibited. The question is whether tech firms are capable of enforcing such rules as AI technology spreads.

"The ChatGPTs of the world -- who do way more good than harm -- make available tools that can write software code in less than a minute that would have taken a bad actor or a bad network potentially days or weeks to run," Jacoby said.

Instead of using ChatGPT to source ideas for recipes or write basic work emails, bad actors could attempt to write large volumes of phishing emails that trick recipients into downloading malware or giving up personal financial information.

Alternatively, similar tools used to analyze and assess trends in large sets of data can potentially be used to fight fraud, Jacoby said. Credit card companies, for example, could benefit from being able to detect anomalies in a customer's behavior to determine if purchases are authentic.

Meanwhile, the U.S. is facing a daily onslaught of cybersecurity breaches from Russian, Chinese and North Korea-backed groups, according to recent U.S. government assessments and private cyber intelligence firms. Experts expect those efforts will test the resilience of the administration’s new cyber strategy.

"They're unbelievably sophisticated and they're unbelievably well-funded and well-tooled," Jacoby said. "They have plenty of AI tools at their disposal."

A recent analysis of underground hacking communities by the cyber firm Check Point Research found online forums where new approaches to hacking tools were discussed, including one discussion thread called "ChatGPT - Benefits of Malware."

The author wrote they were attempting to use ChatGPT to recreate malicious computer code based on research papers about hacking.

While the Biden administration's strategy does not delve into the specifics of emerging technology, such as AI, it's designed to be nimble enough to account for new developments in the rapidly changing cybersecurity landscape.

"These are multi-year efforts where we are going to find gaps and where Congress will then need to lean in to help us get to where we need to go," acting National Cyber Director Kemba Walden said at a forum discussion of the strategy last week. "It's a symphony, not a single movement."

"This is an ongoing process," she added.

Walden emphasized the important role that cloud computing service providers play in securing data as a "force multiplier" for cyber threat first responders.

Google Cloud, for example, provides a variety of data storage and website hosting services. The company's ability to defend its systems was bolstered by its acquisition of the cybersecurity firm Mandiant last year.

"Everyone has a shared responsibility here," said Stacy O'Mara, who leads government strategy and partnership at Mandiant. "I think that's the purpose of the strategy -- to reinforce this concept of a shared defense."

"We've got a long process ahead of us," O'Mara said, " but I'm encouraged by the administration's efforts."Some of the tools can accomplish "in less than a minute" what had taken days.

Sanders' signature at the state Capitol in Little Rock comes 16 days after the 144-page bill was introduced.

"I am not interested in being a caretaker of the failed status quo. I vowed to be a changemaker for our people," she tweeted ahead of the signing. "Today, I am delivering on that promise, and will sign into law my transformational education plan, unleashing a new era of freedom, opportunity and prosperity for all."

Backed by a Republican supermajority in the state Legislature, the omnibus bill cornerstone to Sanders' education agenda saw a 26-8 vote in the State Senate and 78-21 in the House.

"I know it is not popular, I know it went against the Republican Party platform, but right is right and wrong is wrong," said State Rep. Jim Wooten, a former public school teacher, questioning his colleagues' support. "I would say that 50% of them are trying to get close to the governor, and the other 50% are afraid of her."

In its short lifespan, the LEARNS Act, intended to revamp education from early childhood classes through the 12th grade, has seen both praise and protests.

The legislation calls for raising minimum teacher salaries, introducing universal pre-K, banning teaching on "gender identity, sexual orientation, and sexual reproduction" before fifth grade -- prompting comparisons to similar legislation in Florida -- and banning curriculum that would "indoctrinate students with ideologies, such as Critical Race Theory."

It also makes Arkansas the fifth state -- following Arizona, Iowa, Utah and West Virginia -- to enact a universal program for so-called school choice, as more Republican-led legislatures prioritize taking up voucher policies.

"Arkansas is the 5th government school monopoly domino to fall in the past 2 years. A school choice revolution has ignited and there's nothing the teachers unions can do about it," Corey DeAngelis, a prominent advocate for such programs and senior fellow at the American Federation for Children, tweeted on Wednesday.

Supporters of school choice say the vouchers, or "Education Freedom Accounts," as they'll be called under Sanders, allow taxpayers to support "students not systems" in the redirection of public funds to private schools.

"This isn't an us vs. them, red vs. blue, teachers vs. the legislature," said State Sen. Breanne Davis, who introduced the bill. "This is all of us working together and rooting for the success of our children."

The cost of each student's "Education Freedom Account" to pay for private and home-schooling must be equal to 90% of the state's per-student funding for public schools, which is currently $7,413, according to the Associated Press.

But critics say the voucher program essentially functions as a tax stipend for families with the means to enroll their child into private or charter institutions or home-schooling, among other concerns like funding the program long-term.

"At the end of the day, this is only going to be for a few people," said Jim Ross, a history teacher at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, who said the program could serve to "re-segregate" Arkansas schools. "And it's gross that no one will be honest about that."

Those voting against the bill also expressed wanting separation of its sweeping reforms.

"We've never put this many important topics into one piece of legislation and voted on it with one vote," state Sen. Reginald Murdock, a Democrat, said on Tuesday.

'The education governor'

In her inaugural address, Sanders -- a former Trump White House spokesperson whose father, Mike Huckabee, previously served as Arkansas' governor -- said she hopes to be known as "the education governor." She then laid out details of her agenda in the Republican State of the Union response last month.

But the overwhelming support she's seen since in the legislature hasn't been matched by a universally positive public response.

More than 1,000 students at Little Rock Central High School, Sanders' alma mater, walked out of classes on Friday to protest LEARNS.

On Monday, when a group of 10 students tried to speak about the bill at the state Capitol, State Sen. Jane English required the students only speak on its procedural amendment, leaving them feeling "silenced" and "belittled," according to Little Rock Central senior Gryffyn May.

"It was already stressful to have to speak in front of a Senate but then to have to speak without a prepared speech, while you're constantly getting interrupted, was much worse," May told ABC News in a phone interview. "I absolutely had frustrated tears, but they were also tears of embarrassment ... I think it just hit me that this bill was going to be passed on their time, no matter what."

Little Rock Central Junior Addison McCuien told the lawmakers, "I started off my speech here by saying that I wanted to thank y'all for the opportunity to speak. However, I take that back. You're not allowing us the opportunity to speak."

McCuien and May are among the students and educators planning to hold a protest on Wednesday afternoon at the state Capitol. Although the bill will have already been signed, May said it will give students the chance to voice concerns they weren't able to during the session.

"We were completely shut down when people were voting on it, but we're not going to give up and walk away," May said. "We're still going to be out here calling out what's a bad idea."In a major legislative victory for Arkansas' new governor, Sarah Huckabee Sanders on Wednesday signed the LEARNS Act into law, making the state the latest to adopt what she calls a system-changing universal school voucher program, which critics warn could decimate the public school system.

"I am not interested in being a caretaker of the failed status quo. I vowed to be a changemaker for our people," she tweeted ahead of the signing. "Today, I am delivering on that promise, and will sign into law my transformational education plan, unleashing a new era of freedom, opportunity and prosperity for all."

Backed by a Republican supermajority in the state Legislature, the omnibus bill cornerstone to Sanders' education agenda saw a 26-8 vote in the State Senate and 78-21 in the House.

"I know it is not popular, I know it went against the Republican Party platform, but right is right and wrong is wrong," said State Rep. Jim Wooten, a former public school teacher, questioning his colleagues' support. "I would say that 50% of them are trying to get close to the governor, and the other 50% are afraid of her."

In its short lifespan, the LEARNS Act, intended to revamp education from early childhood classes through the 12th grade, has seen both praise and protests.

The legislation calls for raising minimum teacher salaries, introducing universal pre-K, banning teaching on "gender identity, sexual orientation, and sexual reproduction" before fifth grade -- prompting comparisons to similar legislation in Florida -- and banning curriculum that would "indoctrinate students with ideologies, such as Critical Race Theory."

It also makes Arkansas the fifth state -- following Arizona, Iowa, Utah and West Virginia -- to enact a universal program for so-called school choice, as more Republican-led legislatures prioritize taking up voucher policies.

"Arkansas is the 5th government school monopoly domino to fall in the past 2 years. A school choice revolution has ignited and there's nothing the teachers unions can do about it," Corey DeAngelis, a prominent advocate for such programs and senior fellow at the American Federation for Children, tweeted on Wednesday.

Supporters of school choice say the vouchers, or "Education Freedom Accounts," as they'll be called under Sanders, allow taxpayers to support "students not systems" in the redirection of public funds to private schools.

"This isn't an us vs. them, red vs. blue, teachers vs. the legislature," said State Sen. Breanne Davis, who introduced the bill. "This is all of us working together and rooting for the success of our children."

The cost of each student's "Education Freedom Account" to pay for private and home-schooling must be equal to 90% of the state's per-student funding for public schools, which is currently $7,413, according to the Associated Press.

But critics say the voucher program essentially functions as a tax stipend for families with the means to enroll their child into private or charter institutions or home-schooling, among other concerns like funding the program long-term.

"At the end of the day, this is only going to be for a few people," said Jim Ross, a history teacher at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, who said the program could serve to "re-segregate" Arkansas schools. "And it's gross that no one will be honest about that."

Those voting against the bill also expressed wanting separation of its sweeping reforms.

"We've never put this many important topics into one piece of legislation and voted on it with one vote," state Sen. Reginald Murdock, a Democrat, said on Tuesday.

'The education governor'

In her inaugural address, Sanders -- a former Trump White House spokesperson whose father, Mike Huckabee, previously served as Arkansas' governor -- said she hopes to be known as "the education governor." She then laid out details of her agenda in the Republican State of the Union response last month.

But the overwhelming support she's seen since in the legislature hasn't been matched by a universally positive public response.

More than 1,000 students at Little Rock Central High School, Sanders' alma mater, walked out of classes on Friday to protest LEARNS.

On Monday, when a group of 10 students tried to speak about the bill at the state Capitol, State Sen. Jane English required the students only speak on its procedural amendment, leaving them feeling "silenced" and "belittled," according to Little Rock Central senior Gryffyn May.

"It was already stressful to have to speak in front of a Senate but then to have to speak without a prepared speech, while you're constantly getting interrupted, was much worse," May told ABC News in a phone interview. "I absolutely had frustrated tears, but they were also tears of embarrassment ... I think it just hit me that this bill was going to be passed on their time, no matter what."

Little Rock Central Junior Addison McCuien told the lawmakers, "I started off my speech here by saying that I wanted to thank y'all for the opportunity to speak. However, I take that back. You're not allowing us the opportunity to speak."

McCuien and May are among the students and educators planning to hold a protest on Wednesday afternoon at the state Capitol. Although the bill will have already been signed, May said it will give students the chance to voice concerns they weren't able to during the session.

"We were completely shut down when people were voting on it, but we're not going to give up and walk away," May said. "We're still going to be out here calling out what's a bad idea."Kevin McCarthy under fire for turning over raw Jan. 6 video to Fox News host Now, Tucker Carlson is broadcasting selectively edited clips from the thousands of hours of footage the House Speaker turned over to him.Kevin McCarthy under fire for turning over raw Jan. 6 video to Fox News host Now, Tucker Carlson is broadcasting selectively edited clips from the thousands of hours of footage the House Speaker turned over to him.The hearing also touched on possible risks from TikTok and more.

Intelligence chiefs from across the U.S. government faced a grilling on Wednesday from members of the Senate Intelligence Committee on the origins of COVID-19 and China's influence in the world, along with other topics.

The annual hearing on worldwide threats included testimony from, among others, the Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines, CIA Director William Burns, FBI Director Christopher Wray and National Security Agency Director Gen. Paul Nakasone.

"The People's Republic of China, which is increasingly challenging the United States economically, technologically, politically and militarily around the world, remains our unparalleled priority," Haines said.

She said Chinese President Xi Jinping, embarking on an unprecedented third term as his country's leader, will continue to work toward a goal of making China "the preeminent power in East Asia and a major power on the world stage."

China's ruling Community Party, Haines said, "is increasingly convinced that it can only do so at the expense of U.S. power and influence and by using coordinated whole-of-government tools to demonstrate strength and compel neighbors to acquiesce to its preferences, including its land, sea and air claims in the region and its assertions of sovereignty over Taiwan."

Defense Intelligence Agency Director Lt. Gen. Scott Berrier said China's military capabilities "are advancing very, very rapidly in every ... warfighting domain that exists."

"The Defense Intelligence Agency is taking note of that and watching very carefully," Berrier said.

On COVID-19, Wray reaffirmed his bureau's assessment that the origin of the pandemic was likely a lab leak incident in Wuhan, China, a position he also voiced recently on Fox News.

But Haines, speaking next, said there is not yet agreement across the intelligence community on the virus' origins.

"There's a broad consensus in the intelligence community that the outbreak is not the result of a bioweapon or genetic engineering," she said. "What there isn't a consensus on is whether or not it's a lab leak, essentially as Director Wray indicated, or natural exposure to an infected animal."

Pressed on the matter by Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, Haines detailed some of the conflicting views.

"There are four elements plus our National Intelligence Council that assess with low confidence that the infection was most likely caused by natural exposure to an infected animal," she said, adding, "We have the FBI, as you noted, that sees it as more likely that it's a lab leak and has done that with moderate confidence. And the Department of Energy has changed its view slightly with low confidence. It says that a lab leak is most likely, but they do so for different reasons than the FBI does. And their assessments are not identical."

"So you can see how challenging this has been across the community," Haines said.

On TikTok -- the immensely popular video-sharing app owned by the Chinese company ByteDance -- Wray reiterated the concern among some lawmakers and intelligence officials that the platform could be used to exploit the data of millions of American users.

"So if you were to ask Americans, 'Would you like to turn over your data, all your data, control of your devices, control of your information to the [Chinese Communist Party]?' -- most Americans would say, 'I'm not down with that,' as my kids would say," Wray testified.

On Tuesday, Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, unveiled a bill that would empower the president to ban TikTok and maybe other Chinese technology in the United States -- a measure with White House and bipartisan congressional support.

In recent weeks, Congress' intelligence committee leaders have been briefed by officials on a multitude of issues, including the suspected Chinese spy balloon that flew over the U.S. before being shot down off the coast of South Carolina in February and classified documents found at the homes and offices of former President Donald Trump, President Joe Biden and former Vice President Mike Pence.

Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., said at Wednesday's hearing that he wasn't satisfied with the lack of information the panel has gotten on the classified documents issue. He asked Haines and Wray why they haven't personally reviewed all of the classified documents found at the residences of Trump, Biden and Pence to assess what risk their apparent mishandling could have posed to national security.

Both Wray and Haines said they've reviewed some of the classified materials but not all.

"When we get documents that have been compromised in the context of a leak investigation or other things like that, I don't personally review them generally, even when they have significant consequences. There are the subject-matter experts within the institutions that do that. They provide their views and then they typically will summarize or otherwise indicate issues that have to be addressed as a consequence, if there are any," Haines said.

Other topics covered at Wednesday's hearing included Russia's strategy in Ukraine, Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons, North Korea and more.

In one barbed moment, Cotton took exception to a passage in an annual assessment report released by Haines' office on Wednesday: "Transnational [racially or ethnically motivated violent extremists] continue to pose the most lethal threat to U.S. persons and interests, and a significant threat to a number of U.S. allies and partners through attacks and propaganda that espouses violence."

"Are you serious? You seriously think that racially and ethnically motivated violent extremists are the most lethal threat that Americans face?" he asked.

"Yes, sir, in terms of the number of people killed or wounded as a consequence," Haines replied. She could not offer a number of victims off-hand when asked.

Cotton then brought up the high number of U.S. fentanyl deaths, asking, "Isn't that a more lethal threat?"

Haines said, "Absolutely," and clarified the context of the quote from the report -- that it was in comparison to terror threats.

An FBI spokesperson, when asked about the hearing ahead of Wednesday, said Wray would face a number of topics but declined to share anything specific about what the focus would be.

"The hearing will have multiple speakers and cover a variety of topics," FBI spokesperson Christina Pullen told ABC News in an e-mail.

GOP senators on Monday also sent a letter to Haines demanding they receive an intelligence briefing on the origins of COVID-19.

"We write to request that you immediately deliver to Congress each [intelligence community] assessment used and relied upon by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) for its consensus publications," wrote Republican Sens. Collins, Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee and Roger Marshall of Kansas.

"Congress should be able to review the independent evaluations without filters, ambiguity or interpretations of the intelligence," they wrote. 'There is clear bipartisan support in Congress to make these assessments available immediately in full as evidenced by the unanimous March 1, 2023 Senate passage of the COVID-19 Origin Act to declassify information related to the origin of COVID-19."The hearing also touched on possible risks from TikTok and more.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Tuesday warned of potentially devastating consequences of a U.S. debt default and called on Congress to raise the debt ceiling.

Speaking to the Senate banking committee, Powell said a potential U.S. debt default could be "extraordinarily adverse and do longstanding harm."

"At the end of the day, there is only one solution to this problem and that is Congress," he added. "Congress really needs to raise the debt ceiling. That's the only way out."

In testimony before a House committee on Wednesday, Powell reiterated his concern about a potential debt default.

"Congress raising the debt ceiling is really the only alternative," he said. "There are no rabbits in hats to be pulled out on this."

"No one should assume that the Fed can protect the economy from the nonpayment of the government’s bills, let alone a debt default," he added.

The U.S. risks defaulting on its debts as early as July unless the borrowing limit is raised, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said in a report last month.

The federal government on Jan. 19 reached its approximately $31.4 trillion debt ceiling -- which legally caps how much the U.S. can borrow to pay for what tax and other revenue doesn't cover -- and the Treasury Department has since been using "extraordinary measures" along with its current cash flow to keep the government's obligations paid.

Failure to raise the debt limit and the ensuing default on U.S. debt -- which have never happened before -- would all but ensure a U.S. recession that could put millions out of work, economists and budget analysts previously told ABC News.

The remarks from Powell add urgency to an ongoing political dispute in Congress over the debt ceiling.

Some Republicans in the House have resisted an increase of the debt limit unless Democrats agree to spending cuts. The Biden administration, however, has repeatedly said that it will not negotiate over the debt ceiling and that a discussion over spending should occur separately.

When asked whether the current uncertainty about a debt ceiling increase has damaged the economy, Powell said, "In principle, it could."

"I think markets tend and observers tend to watch this and tend to think that it will work out and it has in the past worked out," he added. "And it needs to work out this time, too."

Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, testified to a separate Senate committee on Tuesday on the risk posed by a debt default.

"The Treasury debt limit is an immediate threat to any optimism the economy can skirt recession in the coming year and poses a long-term threat to the nation's finances and economic growth," Zandi said. "Financial markets and the economy would be hit hard."

In addition to comments about the debt ceiling, Powell spoke at length about inflation, which has fallen significantly from a summer peak but is more than triple the Fed's target of 2%.

The inflation fight "has a long way to go and is likely to be bumpy," Powell said.

The Fed last month imposed the latest in an aggressive string of borrowing cost increases as it tries to slash price hikes by slowing the economy and choking off demand. The approach, however, risks tipping the U.S. economy into a recession.

In all, the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates 4.5% over the past year.

Citing elevated inflation and a tight jobs market, Powell said the central bank expects "ongoing increases" to its benchmark interest rate and a sustained period of elevated rates before a change in policy.

Powell has repeatedly said that the Fed will keep its benchmark interest rate elevated until inflation reaches the central bank's 2% target. That means borrowers face higher costs for everything from car loans to credit card debt to mortgages.

"We will stay the course until the job is done," Powell said on Tuesday.

The major stock indexes fell on Tuesday after Powell's remarks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped more than 500 points. The S &P 500 and Nasdaq each dropped more than 1%.

Despite heightened borrowing costs, the economy has largely defied an anticipated slowdown.

The economy added a staggering 517,000 jobs in January, well above the breakneck pace of some 400,000 monthly jobs added on average last year, according to government data released last month.

Fresh retail sales data last month blew past economist expectations, suggesting resilient consumer spending, the lifeblood of the U.S. economy.

The combination of easing inflation and sustained economic growth have raised hope among some of a "soft landing," in which the Fed slows the economy and brings down inflation while preventing the U.S. from entering a recession.

The hot economy could cause inflation to rise, however, prompting the Fed to raise rates further and risk a deeper and more prolonged economic slowdown.

A survey conducted last month by the National Association for Business Economics found that 58% of economists expect a recession in 2023.

Some Democratic senators have raised fears that continued rate hikes could cause an economic downturn that hurts low- and middle-income Americans.

"Raising interest rates can't rebuild our supply chains and fix demand imbalances from the pandemic," Sen. Sherrod Brown said. "Raising interest rates won't end Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine."

"Not only will higher interest rates not solve it," the Ohio Democrat added. "If they're overdone, they'll make it worse."

In response, Powell acknowledged the complex reasons for heightened inflation but reaffirmed the role of the Fed in addressing price increases.

"We're well aware that this particular situation involves a mix of forces, not all of which our tools can affect," Powell said. "But there is a job here for us to do."Powell called on Congress to raise the debt ceiling in Senate testimony.

House Speaker Kevin McCarthy is standing by his decision to grant Fox News host Tucker Carlson access to the raw security footage from the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, telling reporters on Tuesday night that he has no regrets but repeatedly refusing to answer questions about what Carlson said on his show.

"Each person can come up with their own conclusion," McCarthy said about what Carlson aired Monday night, which quickly drew rebuke from Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, top Democrats and the U.S. Capitol Police chief, among others.

ABC News Senior Congressional Correspondent Rachel Scott asked McCarthy, who had previously declined to answer questions on Tuesday, whether he had any concerns about what Carlson presented, pointing to an internal memo from Chief Tom Manger to Capitol Police officers where Manger described Carlson's coverage as "cherry picked," "misleading" and "offensive."

"I didn't see what was aired," McCarthy said, insisting that he gave Carlson -- and no other media outlet -- access to the tapes for the purpose of "transparency."

Carlson on Monday aired what he claimed to be new surveillance videos from the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol in an effort to minimize the rioting as a peaceful gathering and to discredit the work of the House Jan. 6 committee and federal investigators.

In contrast to Carlson's claims now, in the days right after Jan. 6, McCarthy said, "Let me be clear, last week's violent attack on the Capitol was undemocratic, un-American, and criminal."

Attorney General Merrick Garland, asked on Tuesday about Carlson's program, said, "I think it's very clear what happened on Jan. 6."

Carlson and some House Republicans had been hyping the report up for weeks, but after viewing 40,000 hours of video given to him by McCarthy, the host played on repeat only select scenes of the security camera footage.

Carlson defended "protesters" on Jan. 6, claiming they were "right" to "believe that the election they had just voted in had been unfairly conducted." Notably, Carlson's comments come on the heels of new court filings by Dominion Voting Systems in their lawsuit against Fox News that showed in mid-November 2020, Carlson texted one of his producers that "there wasn't enough fraud to change the outcome" of the election.

Despite what he's said in private, Carlson said on Monday that "taken as a whole, the video record does not support the claim that Jan. 6 was an insurrection," though he also showed familiar footage of rioters violently breaking into the Capitol.

Reporters on Tuesday asked if McCarthy believed the Jan. 6 riot was an insurrection, but McCarthy avoided the question entirely.

He said he "worked with Capitol police" on what video would be provided to Carlson, but Chief Manger said in his memo that Fox News never reached out to the Capitol Police for context about what clips they aired.

A Fox News spokeswoman did not respond to ABC News' request for comment on the memo.

On his way to the House floor, McCarthy told ABC News "no" when asked if he had heard any concerns from any Capitol Police officers or any officers on his detail about what was show on Carlson's show.

House Speaker Kevin McCarthy is standing by his decision to grant Fox News host Tucker Carlson access to the raw security footage from the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, telling reporters on Tuesday night that he has no regrets but repeatedly refusing to answer questions about what Carlson said on his show.

"Each person can come up with their own conclusion," McCarthy said about what Carlson aired Monday night, which quickly drew rebuke from Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, top Democrats and the U.S. Capitol Police chief, among others.

ABC News Senior Congressional Correspondent Rachel Scott asked McCarthy, who had previously declined to answer questions on Tuesday, whether he had any concerns about what Carlson presented, pointing to an internal memo from Chief Tom Manger to Capitol Police officers where Manger described Carlson's coverage as "cherry picked," "misleading" and "offensive."

"I didn't see what was aired," McCarthy said, insisting that he gave Carlson -- and no other media outlet -- access to the tapes for the purpose of "transparency."

Carlson on Monday aired what he claimed to be new surveillance videos from the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol in an effort to minimize the rioting as a peaceful gathering and to discredit the work of the House Jan. 6 committee and federal investigators.

In contrast to Carlson's claims now, in the days right after Jan. 6, McCarthy said, "Let me be clear, last week's violent attack on the Capitol was undemocratic, un-American, and criminal."

Former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan declined on Tuesday to close the door on a third-party presidential bid in 2024 after he said Sunday that he would not seek the Republican nomination.

Hogan clarified in an exclusive interview with ABC News that an independent presidential campaign is not something he's "actively" mulling, but he would not definitively say he would not wage one depending on who the Democratic and Republican nominees are.

"I have ruled out seeking the Republican nomination. And I haven't ruled that out [running as an independent]. But it's not something I'm really working toward or thinking about," Hogan said, adding that "the question keeps popping up more and more."

A popular Republican governor in a blue state, Hogan was term-limited out of office earlier this year and had been considering a campaign as an anti-Donald Trump candidate in the 2024 Republican primary.

However, he said over the weekend that he would not contribute to a crowded nominating field in which the former president could emerge as the winner with just a plurality of support, as Trump did in 2016 again Sens. Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio and then-Ohio Gov. John Kasich.

"To once again be a successful governing party, we must move on from Donald Trump. There are several competent Republican leaders who have the potential to step up and lead. But the stakes are too high for me to risk being part of another multicar pileup that could potentially help Mr. Trump recapture the nomination," Hogan said in a statement on Sunday.

Even without him in the race, though, Hogan conceded on Tuesday that any conservative other than Trump -- who has criticized Hogan as a RINO, or Republican in name only -- or Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, the only other potential candidate polling in double digits, faces an uphill climb in clinching the GOP nomination.

The potential crowd is still anticipated to include multiple notable lawmakers, with former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley already running alongside Trump, and there's no significant consolidation in sight.

"We got to find a candidate that can do that. And I don't know who that is at this point," Hogan said of the path for a candidate other than Trump and DeSantis to be successful. "But there can only be one."

"Trump has to stumble, which is hard. And he's been diminishing. But still, he's the 800-pound gorilla. And then if he doesn't make it, it goes to DeSantis, and then DeSantis has to stumble," Hogan said. "And then you have to consolidate everyone else and overcome that."

Yet if Trump does win the GOP primary, Hogan said the centrist political group No Labels, of which he is an honorary co-chair, could cobble together a third-party ticket.

Hogan said the group has "raised about $50 million to get access in all 50 states as kind of an insurance policy" for an "in case of 'emergency break glass'" scenario, referencing a general election matchup between Trump and President Joe Biden, who has said he will run in 2024 as well.

"I mean, they're not trying to start a third party. They're not committed to doing that. But in case the country is burning down, you may have to have an alternative," he said.

Hogan insisted such a ticket would be a last-case scenario but could be sparked by a general election matchup between Trump and Biden -- two politicians with consistently tepid approval ratings nationally who are nonetheless still seen by many as the likeliest nominees for each of their parties.

"I think that would be the trigger. I think that's what they're talking about. I'm not sure we're gonna get to that point. I don't know that. Frankly, I'm hopeful that Donald Trump is not going to be the Republican nominee. And I'm going to work toward that goal. And I'm assuming Biden may be the nominee, but who knows? I mean, he's 80 years old. And we got a long ways to go," Hogan said.

As for his own future, Hogan appeared open -- among other possibilities -- to having his name on such a ticket should one be launched.

"I'm not sure if it's feasible. And it's also just not something I'm working toward," he said. "But, I mean, look, if you got to an election when the nominees were Biden and Trump and 70% of America didn't want that, you wouldn't rule it out, right?"The former governor said, "The question keeps popping up more and more."

Ron DeSantis has said he would sign should it be sent to his desk.

"We're for pro-life. I urge the legislature to work, produce good stuff, and we will sign," DeSantis said during a February briefing when asked if he would approve a so-called heartbeat bill that would ban abortions after six weeks.

The state currently prohibits almost all abortions after 15 weeks, restrictions that were put in place in July as the state appealed after a judge's ruling that the law violated the state's constitution.

The new bill would prohibit "physicians from knowingly performing or inducing a termination of pregnancy after the gestational age of the fetus is determined to be more than 6 weeks, rather than 15 weeks," according to its text, with exceptions for rape and incest or if needed to save the life of the mother -- under specific conditions.

For example, two doctors, if available, would have to certify in writing that an abortion is needed to prevent the pregnant woman's death or "avert a serious risk of substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function."

In the case of a fatal fetal abnormality as attested to two by two physicians, the pregnancy could not be in the third trimester.

For victims of rape and incest, the pregnancy can't be further than 15 weeks along and the woman has to provide a police report, restraining order, court order or other such documentation.

A six-week abortion ban would bar the procedure before many people identify their pregnancies. Pregnancies are counted based on the first day of a person's last menstrual period, so by the time they miss their next period and take a test, they can already be four weeks in. And people with irregular cycles, or those uncertain of their cycle dates, might not recognize a missed period that quickly -- taking them to six weeks or beyond before they know they're pregnant.

The bill also prohibits any party other than a physician from inducing a termination of pregnancy, requires that medications intended for use in an abortion be dispensed in person by a physician and prohibits the dispensing of such medication through the U.S. Postal Service or any other courier or shipping service.

The proposal was introduced on the first day of the state's 60-day legislative session by freshman state Sen. Erin Grall, a Republican who, when she was in the House last session, introduced Florida's current 15-week ban. State Rep. Jenna Persons-Mulicka on Tuesday also filed a six-week abortion ban in her chamber.

“I believe that we have a unique opportunity in the fact that the Supreme Court is considering 15 weeks right now, and this would allow Florida to save as many babies as possible as soon as possible after that decision is made,” Grall said during a hearing in January 2022.

The White House quickly responded to the legislation on Tuesday, saying it would have a "devastating impact on women's health."

"Republican state legislators in Florida proposed today a bill that would ban abortion before many women know if they are even pregnant, virtually eliminating a woman's right to make health care decisions about her own body," White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said during a briefing on Tuesday.

She said that the ban would also impact women in southern states who rely on Florida as an "option to access care."

"Like the overwhelming majority of Americans, the president and the vice president believe women should be able to make health care decisions with their own doctors and families, free from political interference. Period," Jean-Pierre said. "They are committed to protecting access to reproductive care and continuing to call on Congress to restore the protections of Roe v. Wade [the overruled Supreme Court abortion decision]."

The Florida bill was filed Tuesday just ahead of DeSantis' State of the State address, though he did not refer to or comment on it during his speech.

The rising-star Republican who has visited various parts of the country -- including Iowa, the first presidential nominating state, this week -- is expected to energize the state's GOP majority this session with conservative policy even as he's quelled any discussion about his own White House ambitions.

ABC News' Hannah Demissie, Alexandra Hutzler and Jay O'Brien contributed to this report.A bipartisan group of senior senators on Tuesday unveiled plans to introduce a bill they hope will effectively ban TikTok -- as well as future apps that they say might jeopardize U.S. national security -- joining a growing chorus of lawmakers seeking a nationwide ban of the popular social media platform used by some 100 million Americans, including politicians, every day.

The legislation, authored by Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Mark Warner and No. 2 Senate Republican John Thune, would give new powers to the Commerce Department to scrutinize foreign technology from China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, Venezuela, and Cuba, including applications like TikTok, which is owned by Chinese company ByteDance.

The new powers would include the ability to disband any company deemed a national security threat. Warner also cited the concerns voiced by many lawmakers that the video-sharing app could be used as a propaganda tool of the Chinese Communist Party.

"The Restrict Act is more than about TikTok and will give us that comprehensive approach," Warner said in unveiling the bill.

"Our legislation says that any foreign communications technology that poses a national security risk -- and one of the key things about or bill as well says that it's incumbent upon the intelligence community to declassify as much information as possible to make that case -- that we give the commerce secretary the tools to mitigate to divest up to and including banning these sort of technologies," he told ABC News.

The Biden administration at the end of February gave federal agencies 30 days to wipe TikTok from all federal government systems and devices, per a congressional ban enacted with sweeping bipartisan support in December.

Many agencies, including the Defense Department and Department of Homeland Security, had already enacted bans. Canada and the European Union have taken similar steps. India has long banned the app.

Warner said he and Thune worked very closely with the White House on the legislation and as they unveiled it, the White House put out a statement supporting the measure and urging Congress to send it to President Joe Biden to sign.

"This legislation would empower the United States government to prevent certain foreign governments from exploiting technology services operating in the United States in a way that poses risks to Americans' sensitive data and our national security," White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said in a statement. "We look forward to continue working with both Democrats and Republicans on this bill, and urge Congress to act quickly to send it to the President's desk."

All of this is coming at a time of growing strife between the two superpowers particularly in the wake of the China spy balloon that entered U.S. airspace and was shot down on the orders of President Biden and threats that the Asian nation might arm Russia in its war against Ukraine, among numerous examples of conflict.

"The Chinese Communist Party has proven over the last few years that is willing to lie about just about everything. That likely won't end with TikTok, which is why it's important to establish a holistic and methodical approach to the challenges that are posed by technology from foreign adversaries. Safe to assume that the CCP is willing to lie about its spy balloon and cover up the origins of the worst pandemic than 100 years, they'll lie about using Tiktok to spy on American citizens," Thune told reporters in a news conference Tuesday.

Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, a co-sponor of the bill, said, "We have to recognize that we face geopolitical adversaries that are serious and threaten our security, our prosperity, and even the peace and freedom that we enjoy."

Noting criticism that the bill would infringe on the privacy of Americans, Romney said, "One thing a lot worse than having our government infringe on our privacy is having the Chinese Communist Party infringe on our privacy and be able to track us and follow us. And whether it's with social media or other technologies, communication technologies or hardware that they devise over the coming years, we have to make sure that we have the resources in place and the authorities in place to stop those things before they endanger us."

TikTok has consistently denied that its China-based parent company is using the app to spy on Americans. And following approval in the House Foreign Affairs Committee of a bipartisan bill that would empower President Biden to ban TikTok, the company fired back, "A US ban on TikTok is a ban on the export of American culture and values to the billion-plus people who use our service worldwide. We're disappointed to see this rushed piece of legislation move forward, despite its considerable negative impact on the free-speech rights of millions of Americans who use and love TikTok."

Citing past Congressional efforts to ban the federal government use of products from foreign companies deemed a threat to U.S. national security, like Russian based anti-malware company Kaspersky Lab, and China's Huawei Technologies and ZTE, Warner said he wants to move beyond the current "whack-a-mole approach that we've had with the threats of foreign technology." Instead, the Virginia Democrat and former tech entrepreneur said it's time to view national security threats through a modern day lens and not "the old definition…which were planes, tanks, and guns." The senator said the new field of confrontation is "morphing into who controls and wins the technology battle."

The Warner-Thune bill, also sponsored by five Democrats and five Republicans, might also withstand court scrutiny with specific legislation empowering a new federal agency within the Commerce Department. Cold War-era laws designed to protect entertainment industries from any retaliation by the president, and later expanded to include First Amendment concerns, were used by TikTok in a suit during the Trump administration which sought to restrict the social media behemoth.

Not all lawmakers are on board with such a ban, either.

Rep. Gregory Meeks, the top Democrat on the Foreign Affairs Committee, told ABC News Live Tuesday, "I think that we have to get all of the evidence first, as opposed to the bill that was produced in the House Foreign Affairs Committee last week, where it basically said that there should be a ban on TikTok almost immediately. I believe that the bill as written, you know, basically ties the Biden administration's hands," who pointed to a department within the Treasury Department that analyzes foreign investments in the U.S.

"I think that as opposed to rushing into it, there's ways that we could make sure that we protect and should sanctions be needed, then the administration has the power to do it as opposed to having mandatory sanctions now, which I think would be--could cause more headaches than others because it could cause headaches with our allies."

Noting criticism that the bill would infringe on the privacy of Americans, Romney said, "One thing a lot worse than having our government infringe on our privacy is having the Chinese Communist Party infringe on our privacy and be able to track us and follow us. And whether it's with social media or other technologies, communication technologies or hardware that they devise over the coming years, we have to make sure that we have the resources in place and the authorities in place to stop those things before they endanger us."

TikTok has consistently denied that its China-based parent company is using the app to spy on Americans. And following approval in the House Foreign Affairs Committee of a bipartisan bill that would empower President Biden to ban TikTok, the company fired back, "A US ban on TikTok is a ban on the export of American culture and values to the billion-plus people who use our service worldwide. We're disappointed to see this rushed piece of legislation move forward, despite its considerable negative impact on the free-speech rights of millions of Americans who use and love TikTok."

Citing past Congressional efforts to ban the federal government use of products from foreign companies deemed a threat to U.S. national security, like Russian based anti-malware company Kaspersky Lab, and China's Huawei Technologies and ZTE, Warner said he wants to move beyond the current "whack-a-mole approach that we've had with the threats of foreign technology." Instead, the Virginia Democrat and former tech entrepreneur said it's time to view national security threats through a modern day lens and not "the old definition…which were planes, tanks, and guns." The senator said the new field of confrontation is "morphing into who controls and wins the technology battle."

The Warner-Thune bill, also sponsored by five Democrats and five Republicans, might also withstand court scrutiny with specific legislation empowering a new federal agency within the Commerce Department. Cold War-era laws designed to protect entertainment industries from any retaliation by the president, and later expanded to include First Amendment concerns, were used by TikTok in a suit during the Trump administration which sought to restrict the social media behemoth.

Not all lawmakers are on board with such a ban, either.

Rep. Gregory Meeks, the top Democrat on the Foreign Affairs Committee, told ABC News Live Tuesday, "I think that we have to get all of the evidence first, as opposed to the bill that was produced in the House Foreign Affairs Committee last week, where it basically said that there should be a ban on TikTok almost immediately. I believe that the bill as written, you know, basically ties the Biden administration's hands," who pointed to a department within the Treasury Department that analyzes foreign investments in the U.S.

"I think that as opposed to rushing into it, there's ways that we could make sure that we protect and should sanctions be needed, then the administration has the power to do it as opposed to having mandatory sanctions now, which I think would be--could cause more headaches than others because it could cause headaches with our allies."

With his reelection bid underway, Trump asked Sanders for her endorsement in a phone call "weeks ago," according to the New York Times. The Times reported Sanders replied she wouldn't yet do so and hasn't weighed in publicly since.

Trump, for his part, denied asking for her endorsement on Sunday on his Truth Social media platform, saying he never asked Sanders for her endorsement, while taking credit for her political success.

"I give endorsements, I don't generally ask for them," Trump posted. "With that being said, nobody has done more for her than I have, with the possible exception of her great father, Mike."

Trump's spokesperson and Sanders' office had not responded to ABC News' requests for comment as of Tuesday afternoon.

Sanders, the longest-serving White House press secretary under Trump, followed in the footsteps of her father, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, to become the first father-daughter governor duo of the same state in the nation.

But it was serving in Trump's White House that propelled Sanders to become a household name herself.

Some of Trump's most enthusiastic supporters, such as Steve Bannon, are questioning why Trump hadn't seen more endorsements. Bannon and Sanders worked together in Trump's White House until he was removed from his position as chief strategist in Aug. 2017.

"Sarah ... are you listening?" he said on his podcast "The War Room."

In an interview in January on "Fox News Sunday," Sanders declined the opportunity to endorse Trump and said her focus was on serving Arkansas, not 2024.

"My focus right now has been on 2022, winning the election in November, preparing through transition and getting ready to take office, as I did this past week. I love the president. I have a great relationship with him. I know our country will be infinitely better off if he was in office right now instead of Joe Biden," Sanders said. "My focus isn't on 2024."

The Arkansas state legislature on Tuesday is expected to pass Sanders' landmark legislation, the LEARNS Act, which imitates elements of Florida's education policy enacted under Gov. Ron DeSantis -- thought to be Trump's closest competitor in 2024. Sanders also tapped DeSantis' education secretary Jacob Oliva to bring Florida's plan to Arkansas as it's unclear if she could be waiting for another candidate to endorse.

According to an Axios report on Tuesday, Sanders is among four women Trump is currently considering as vice presidential pick. The others include South Dakota Kristi Noem, Gov. former U.N. Ambassador and South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, the most high-profile of Trump's announced challengers, and Kari Lake, who has not conceded the race for Arizona governor.Sarah Huckabee Sanders touted her endorsement from former President Donald Trump to help win the Arkansas governor's mansion, but although Trump reportedly has asked her to return the favor for his 2024 White House bid, Sanders so far has kept publicly silent.

California Sen. Dianne Feinstein has been released from the hospital and is recovering at home after being treated for shingles, she said Tuesday.

"I want to thank everyone for the well wishes and the hospital staff for providing excellent care. I’m recovering at home now while I continue receiving treatment and look forward to returning to the Senate as soon as possible," Feinstein tweeted.

It's not yet clear when Feinstein will return to the Senate. Her prolonged absence, paired with that of Pennsylvania Senator John Fetterman, who is being treated for depression, means that Republicans currently have a 50-49 majority right now though Democratic leader Chuck Schumer remains in control of the chamber's voting schedule.

A spokesperson for Feinstein's office on Thursday originally announced her hospitalization, after was first reported by The San Francisco Chronicle.

“I was diagnosed over the February recess with a case of shingles. I have been hospitalized and am receiving treatment in San Francisco and expect to make a full recovery," Feinstein said in a statement then. "I hope to return to the Senate later this month."

Shingles is caused by the same virus, varicella-zoster virus, that causes chickenpox and is characterized by a painful rash that develops on the face or body. A person sickened by chickenpox and who recovers can later get shingles when the virus reactivates.

While about one in every three people in the U.S. develops shingles, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, only about 1-4% need to be hospitalized.

At 89, Feinstein is the oldest serving member of the Senate.

Last month, she announced that she would not run for reelection after her term is up in early 2025 but will continue serving until then and "intend[s] to accomplish as much for California as I can."

She said then that she remains focused on passing legislation important to Democrats through the end of her term, including curbing gun violence in the face of a string of mass shootings and ameliorating homelessness and wildfires.

After announcing her retirement to her colleagues during a closed-door lunch, Feinstein spoke briefly to reporters, saying, "The time has come."

California Reps. Barbara Lee, Katie Porter and Adam Schiff have all announced bids to succeed her.

The memo, obtained by ABC News, said "the opinion program never reached out to the Department to provide accurate context."

"The program conveniently cherry-picked from the calmer moments of our 41,000 hours of video," Manger wrote. "The commentary fails to provide context about the chaos and violence that happened before or during the less tense moments."

But as one Republican leader declined to take questions on his way into the Capitol -- another Republican leader wasted no time addressing it.

Even before being asked by reporters, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell held up a printed copy of the Capitol Police internal memo on Tuesday afternoon.

"With regard to the presentation on Fox News last night, I want to associate myself entirely with the opinion of the Capitol Police about what happened on Jan. 6," McConnell said.

Asked if it were a mistake to give security footage to Carlson, McConnell said, "My concern is how it was depicted, which was a different issue. Clearly the chief of the Capitol Police, in my view, correctly describes what most of us witnessed firsthand on Jan. 6. So, that's my reaction to it. It was a mistake, in my view, for Fox News to depict this in a way that is completely at variance with what our chief law enforcement official here at the Capitol thinks."

Manger, who was sworn in in July 2021, told Capitol Police in the memo that television programs will not "record the truth for our history books" and added that "the truth and justice are on our side." He didn't mention Carlson by name in the letter, but it's clear he's referring to his programming.

Carlson on Monday aired what he claimed to be new surveillance videos from the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol in an effort to minimize the Capitol attack as a peaceful gathering and to discredit the work of the Jan. 6 committee and federal investigators.

In contrast to Carlson's claims now, in the days right after Jan. 6, McCarthy said, "Let me be clear, last week's violent attack on the Capitol was undemocratic, un-American, and criminal."

Attorney General Merrick Garland, asked on Tuesday about Carlson's program, said, "I think it's very clear what happened on Jan. 6."

"I think all Americans saw what happened on Jan. 6, and most of it saw most of us, saw it as it was happening," Garland said at a news conference. "It was a violent attack on a fundamental tenant of American democracy -- that power is peacefully transferred from one administration to another. Over 100 officers were assaulted on that day. Five officers died. We have charged more than 1000 people with their crimes on that day and more than 500 have already been convicted. I think it's very clear what happened on Jan. 6."

Carlson and some House Republicans have been hyping the report up for weeks, but after viewing 40,000 hours of video given to him by McCarthy, he played on repeat only select scenes of the security camera footage.

Carlson defended "protesters" on Jan. 6, claiming they were "right" to "believe that the election they had just voted in had been unfairly conducted." Notably, Carlson's comments come on the heels of new court filings by Dominion Voting Systems in their lawsuit against Fox News that showed in mid-November 2020, Carlson texted one of his producers that "there wasn't enough fraud to change the outcome" of the election.

Despite what he's said in private, Carlson said on Monday that "taken as a whole, the video record does not support the claim that Jan. 6 was an insurrection," despite also showing familiar footage of rioters violently breaking into the Capitol.

"They were not insurrectionists," he said. "They were sightseers."

Carlson also selectively picked footage that showed protesters standing around inside the Capitol and argued it proved, "They're not destroying the Capitol. They obviously revere the Capitol." However, Carlson failed to mention that over a million dollars in damage were sustained during the attack on the Capitol.

There are multiple falsehoods, contortions and clear omissions in Carlson's report.

One of which relates to Jacob Chansley, the self-described "Q-Anon Shaman" who infamously marched through the Capitol with a spear and horned helmet during the riot and who has been sentenced to 41 months in prison for his role in the attack.

Carlson questioned why the video he aired tonight of Chansley -- which he said depicted Chansley being led through the Capitol by police -- didn't come out at trial. But the case never went to trial. Chansley pleaded guilty to one felony count of unlawfully obstructing an official proceeding.

"When greatly outnumbered during a violent demonstration, officers are trained to use a variety of techniques to prevent violent and destructive behavior including -- when possible -- engaging with those behaving non-violently and encouraging them to demonstrate peacefully or depart the location," said ABC News Contributor John Cohen, a former acting undersecretary for intelligence at the Department of Homeland Security. "Especially if they viewed him as a potential agitator. Walking him away quietly from the crowd thereby reduces the likelihood he will incite violence."

It's not immediately clear whether Chansley's defense attorneys, who were provided hours of footage showing his movements throughout the Capitol and other items of discovery in his case -- were not able to access this video before he entered his guilty plea. An attorney for Chansley did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment.

ABC News has repeatedly asked for the footage McCarthy gave exclusively to Carlson and reached out to McCarthy's office for his response to the misleading report after McCarthy condemned the Capitol attack on Jan. 6.

ABC News' Alexander Mallin contributed to this report.Virginia state Senate candidate Monica Gary is open about her past. National outlets have already picked up her story because of her background as a former dancer at strip clubs.

But Gary says her backstory also includes growing up in poverty in Stafford County, having a premature baby at 17, leaving an abusive partner and eventually turning to a life of ministry and public service.

As for her time in clubs, she said it came about after her son’s biological father came back into the picture.

“Because I grew up in purity culture, I thought, 'Well, ‘I'm broken, so no one's ever gonna want me. I'll just be with this guy who's already awful to me because maybe he'll want me.'“ Gary said. “That continued into more of a domestic trafficking situation. He suggested strongly that I would dance at the clubs where I had gone to just waitress, and that just kind of snowballed.”

Now, Gary has seven kids -- two of whom are active duty in the military -- and she has been married to her husband, Peter, for 14 years. They met when Gary, who was in an abusive relationship, was still working at clubs, she said.

“He just was a friend to me,” Gary said. “He treated me with so much dignity.”

Gary, who has a theology degree, has worked in ministry for years, and she started New Wine Community Church in Stafford in 2019. The former dancer has also served on the Stafford County Board of Supervisors since 2022, representing the Aquia District.

The current Virginia General Assembly has no independent members, and partisan control of the legislature is split, with a 21-18 Democratic majority in the Senate and a 52-48 Republican majority in the House of Delegates. State Sen. Jill Holtzman Vogel (R-Clarke County) currently represents the 27th District, which Gary is running for, though its borders are now different due to redistricting. Vogel is not seeking reelection.

The newly drawn 27th District covers parts of Stafford and Spotsylvania counties and Fredericksburg city. In the 2020 presidential election, Stafford County -- which makes up about 60% of the 27th District -- voted for Biden 51%-47%. Spotsylvania County -- the next largest chunk of the district -- voted for Trump 52%-46%. Biden carried the smallest chunk, Fredericksburg, 66%-31%.

Gary said she filed as an independent because she doesn't want to alienate voters.

"If I put a letter next to my name, immediately half of the population is going to say, 'You're not going to work for me. You're not going to help me and even worse, you're going to hurt me,'" Gary said. "That's not acceptable to me."

Gary highlights three issues on her campaign website: transportation, reproductive rights and education.

The state Senate hopeful touted her tenure on the Fredericksburg Area Metropolitan Planning Organization Policy Board as evidence that she's prepared to tackle the problem of congestion, saying the issue requires nuance because the district has both urban and rural areas.

"We have a very diverse district, the new 27th, which I guess technically there's no incumbent because it's a brand new district. It's very diverse. So we have very rural roads that need improvements and maintenance and then we also have very urban areas like in Fredericksburg," she said.

When it comes to education, Virginia is one of the centers for the battle over school choice, or a policy that allows parents to send their children to private schools and have the costs covered, at least in part, by publicly funded vouchers. Proponents of school choice believe it gives parents a better say over their children’s education and allows some students to leave under-performing schools. Opponents believe it takes funding away from public schools and leaves many students behind.

Gary’s position against school choice is influenced by her time as a public school student and as a mother who, aside from a brief period of homeschooling her children during COVID-19, sends them to public schools.

“This is not going to open up opportunities for most families who may want to utilize those vouchers. It's not going to cover the whole tuition,” Gary said. “So now you already have folks who probably already afford private school funding, but now they’re getting a discount.”

As for the issue of reproductive rights, Gary also invokes her personal experiences.

“I am very open about this: I have had abortions,” Gary said.

After her procedure, she said she “overcorrected” and was anti-abortion, then looked back on how her life would have gone without access to abortions.

“It would have meant staying in a very abusive relationship,” Gary said. “It would have meant ... a lot of awful things continued in my life.”

While her support for abortion rights puts her to the left of many Republicans' perspective, her belief on when life starts differ from the view held by most liberals.

“I'm Christian, and I believe that personhood happens even before conception, right? I believe that God knew me even before I was here and he had a purpose for my life,” Gary said. “But that doesn't mean that I go in and say I believe a, b, and c so you have to do all of these things.”

The primary election for the 27th District is June 20, but because Gary isn't participating in a political primary, her name will not appear on Virginians' ballots until the general election on Nov. 7.Virginia state Senate candidate Monica Gary is open about her past.

I'll just be with this guy who's already awful to me because maybe he'll want me.'“ Gary said. “That continued into more of a domestic trafficking situation. He suggested strongly that I would dance at the clubs where I had gone to just waitress, and that just kind of snowballed.”

Now, Gary has seven kids -- two of whom are active duty in the military -- and she has been married to her husband, Peter, for 14 years. They met when Gary, who was in an abusive relationship, was still working at clubs, she said.

“He just was a friend to me,” Gary said. “He treated me with so much dignity.”

Gary, who has a theology degree, has worked in ministry for years, and she started New Wine Community Church in Stafford in 2019. The former dancer has also served on the Stafford County Board of Supervisors since 2022, representing the Aquia District.

The current Virginia General Assembly has no independent members, and partisan control of the legislature is split, with a 21-18 Democratic majority in the Senate and a 52-48 Republican majority in the House of Delegates. State Sen. Jill Holtzman Vogel (R-Clarke County) currently represents the 27th District, which Gary is running for, though its borders are now different due to redistricting. Vogel is not seeking reelection.

The newly drawn 27th District covers parts of Stafford and Spotsylvania counties and Fredericksburg city. In the 2020 presidential election, Stafford County -- which makes up about 60% of the 27th District -- voted for Biden 51%-47%. Spotsylvania County -- the next largest chunk of the district -- voted for Trump 52%-46%. Biden carried the smallest chunk, Fredericksburg, 66%-31%.

Gary said she filed as an independent because she doesn't want to alienate voters.

"If I put a letter next to my name, immediately half of the population is going to say, 'You're not going to work for me. You're not going to help me and even worse, you're going to hurt me,'" Gary said. "That's not acceptable to me."

Gary highlights three issues on her campaign website: transportation, reproductive rights and education.

The state Senate hopeful touted her tenure on the Fredericksburg Area Metropolitan Planning Organization Policy Board as evidence that she's prepared to tackle the problem of congestion, saying the issue requires nuance because the district has both urban and rural areas.

"We have a very diverse district, the new 27th, which I guess technically there's no incumbent because it's a brand new district. It's very diverse. So we have very rural roads that need improvements and maintenance and then we also have very urban areas like in Fredericksburg," she said.

When it comes to education, Virginia is one of the centers for the battle over school choice, or a policy that allows parents to send their children to private schools and have the costs covered, at least in part, by publicly funded vouchers. Proponents of school choice believe it gives parents a better say over their children’s education and allows some students to leave under-performing schools. Opponents believe it takes funding away from public schools and leaves many students behind.

Gary’s position against school choice is influenced by her time as a public school student and as a mother who, aside from a brief period of homeschooling her children during COVID-19, sends them to public schools.

“This is not going to open up opportunities for most families who may want to utilize those vouchers. It's not going to cover the whole tuition,” Gary said. “So now you already have folks who probably already afford private school funding, but now they’re getting a discount.”

As for the issue of reproductive rights, Gary also invokes her personal experiences.

“I am very open about this: I have had abortions,” Gary said.

After her procedure, she said she “overcorrected” and was anti-abortion, then looked back on how her life would have gone without access to abortions.

“It would have meant staying in a very abusive relationship,” Gary said. “It would have meant ... a lot of awful things continued in my life.”

While her support for abortion rights puts her to the left of many Republicans' perspective, her belief on when life starts differ from the view held by most liberals.

“I'm Christian, and I believe that personhood happens even before conception, right? I believe that God knew me even before I was here and he had a purpose for my life,” Gary said. “But that doesn't mean that I go in and say I believe a, b, and c so you have to do all of these things.”

The primary election for the 27th District is June 20, but because Gary isn't participating in a political primary, her name will not appear on Virginians' ballots until the general election on Nov. 7.
