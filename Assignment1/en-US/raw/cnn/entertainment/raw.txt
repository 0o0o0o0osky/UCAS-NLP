The Oscars have always served as a celebration of movies, carving out time not devoted to the “And the Oscar goes to” part to cheerleading for Hollywood. Yet with movies in a state of flux amid the shift to streaming and a global pandemic that hobbled theaters, Academy voters appear to be trying to strike a balance between streaming and blockbusters, and whether they can be, if not everything everywhere all at once, all things to all people.

If the awards in the run-up to the Academy Awards hold true, “Everything Everywhere All at Once” will walk away with the most coveted hardware. Having amassed honors from the guilds representing directors, producers, writers, actors, and editors, its frontrunner status has been cemented in place.

Should that prediction hold, Oscar voters will anoint a movie that actually thrived box-office-wise – earning more than $100 million worldwide, a record for its independent distributor, A24 – while still feeling small-boned compared to the titans that have led a movie-going comeback.

At one of those aforementioned award events, director Steven Spielberg thanked Tom Cruise for having “saved” Hollywood with “Top Gun: Maverick,” the long-delayed sequel that earned nearly $1.5 billion worldwide at the box office. The same could be said for James Cameron’s “Avatar: The Way of Water,” which like its predecessor soared above the $2-billion global plateau to become the third-highest-grossing title of all time.

Despite its relative commercial success, “Everything Everywhere” – a mind-bending trip through a multiverse of possibilities – tilts toward a more intimate brand of filmmaking, joining movies like “Nomadland” and “Moonlight” in notching wins at the Independent Spirit Award on its march to the Oscars.

While major studio releases can earn an invitation to the Oscar party, despite the gratitude that Spielberg articulated, that probably won’t translate to the guest-of-honor seat. And the skepticism about honoring big movies reflects a lingering schism, if not quite disdain, in regard to the kind of fare that in recent years has dominated the box office, particularly when it comes to superheroes and science fiction – films perceived to put a premium on spectacle and experience at the expense of plot and story.

The Academy has publicly grappled with this dynamic, even flirting a few years ago with introducing a “popular film” category before nixing the idea. Such allowances weren’t deemed necessary back when mass appeal and awards frequently went hand in hand, including best-picture wins for Cameron’s “Titanic,” “Gladiator” and “The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King.”

To an extent, just nominating popular films might help spur interest in the ceremony and improve ratings, a major incentive. With its worldwide gross of $2.3 billion, “Avatar’s” tally is more than four times that of the other eight best-picture contenders (excluding “Top Gun”) combined.

At the same time, Hollywood has embraced streaming as a viable awards option, without fully tackling the fact that movies designed to thrive on those platforms are playing a somewhat different game.

The pandemic helped erode that resistance, as witnessed by best-picture honors for Apple TV+’s “CODA” and Hulu’s “Nomadland,” both produced for roughly the same amount “Avatar” likely spent on its catering budget.

Even with a diminished presence at this year’s Oscars, streaming services probably won’t leave empty handed. A pair of Netflix offerings, best-picture nominee “All Quiet on the Western Front” and “Guillermo del Toro’s Pinocchio,” are leading contenders for best international feature and animated movie, respectively.

In an analysis for Variety, awards expert Tim Gray saw a glass-half-full scenario in this year’s Oscar nominees, citing the wide cross-section of films, “from big epics to intimate dramas,” and noting that while many address dark topics, “they generally conclude on a note of hope. That’s true of the characters — and of moviegoing in the 21st century.”

With a robust lineup of theatrical releases slated for spring and summer, the rebuilding process that “Avatar,” “Top Gun” and “Spider-Man: No Way Home” began continues.

Yet it’s equally possible to look at the eclectic lineup of Oscars nominees, including numerous movies that flopped when released in theaters, and conclude that the entertainment industry remains pulled in multiple directions, without a clear blueprint to what the future holds.

In that sense, the Oscars might end up proving that you can have “Everything Everywhere All at Once,” but not have your cake and eat it too.

The women and girls of Showtime’s hit series “Yellowjackets” are back, and they’re continuing to flirt with the darkness in the Season 2 trailer, released on Thursday.

The creepy clip begins with the scarred Van, played as a teen by Liv Hewson, telling a fireside tale about the “wilderness” – also known as the unforgiving forest the soccer team finds themselves still stranded in after the horrifying plane crash from last season – calling it beautiful, violent and “misunderstood.”

“And it waited and waited to befriend whoever arrived,” Van continues cryptically.

Not only does the trailer give viewers a glimpse at the adult Van, played by “Six Feet Under” star Lauren Ambrose, but it also confirms that Lottie (Courtney Eaton), until now only seen as her kooky teen self, survived the Yellowjackets’ ordeal. The character is played as an adult by Simone Kessell.

In one heated moment among the surviving adult counterparts, someone says, “Lottie can help us.”

Christina Ricci’s Misty asks feverishly, “The Lottie who was committed to a mental institution in Switzerland, Lottie?!”

“Yes,” adult Natalie (Juliette Lewis) replies.

Set to a beguiling new cover of No Doubt’s signature hit “Just a Girl” by none other than Florence + The Machine, the “Yellowjackets” trailer also reveals Taissa’s (Tawny Cypress) significant and continued mental issues, as well as adult Shauna (Melanie Lynskey) low-key owning up to her murderous ways to her daughter.

Toward the end, after the teen clan hauntingly chants, “We hear the wilderness, and it hears us,” a brief snippet shows the younger Misty (Samantha Hanratty) and Van shouldering a log… with a person tied to it.

“I think sh**’s gonna get a lot worse out here,” someone says in voice-over, a statement that shocks essentially no one who’s been watching the show.

Season 2 of “Yellowjackets” also features new cast addition Elijah Wood. It premieres on Showtime on March 24.CNN —

Robert Blake, noted actor and Emmy-winner who starred in crime series “Baretta,” has died, according to his daughter, Delinah Blake Hurwitz. He was 89.

Delinah Blake Hurwitz told CNN in an email that her father died “peacefully” on Thursday “surrounded by family.”

Robert Blake died in Los Angeles from heart disease, according to his niece Noreen Austin, who released an obituary notice via a representative.

Over the course of more than 60 years working as a professional actor, Robert Blake amassed a number of memorable credits, including 1967’s “In Cold Blood” and David Lynch’s 1997 film “Lost Highway,” the actor’s final screen credit.

In 2001, Robert Blake’s second wife Bonny Lee Bakley was found murdered in the San Fernando Valley. In 2005, the actor was acquitted of murder charges relating to the case. He later lost a civil suit brought forth by Bakley’s children.

A vast career

Robert Blake, born in Nutley, New Jersey on September 18, 1933, went by his birth name of Michael Gubitosi until 1942. He got his start in Hollywood as a child actor in the “Our Gang” movie shorts in 1939 as Mickey, one of the Little Rascals, continuing under the name of “Bobby Blake” in various “Our Gang” shorts until the early ’40s.

He starred in his first film in 1942 as Daniel ‘Mokey’ Delano in “Mokey,” about a troubled young boy navigating life at home with his father and stepmother. In 1948, he appeared in “Treasure of the Sierra Madre,” which costarred the legendary Humphrey Bogart.

In 1967, Robert Blake starred as Perry in the film “In Cold Blood,” based on Truman Capote’s 1965 novel of the same name, about the murder of a family in Holcomb, Kansas.

Robert Blake later went on to star in the 1970s television crime series “Baretta.” He won an Emmy Award for his role on the show, in which he played the title character, a New York City undercover detective. The series aired for four seasons on ABC from 1975-1978.

His other notable credits include the 1960s series “Rawhide,” the 1981 TV movie “Of Mice and Men” and 1995’s “Money Train” with Woody Harrelson and Jennifer Lopez.

Criminal trial

On May 4, 2001, Robert Blake’s wife, Bonny Lee Bakley, was found shot in the head in his car after eating at Vitello’s, a neighborhood restaurant in Studio City. Robert Blake said at the time that the murder occurred while he had briefly returned to the restaurant.

Robert Blake was arrested in April 2002 on charges of first degree murder with special circumstances and two counts of solicitation of murder. He pleaded not guilty at his arraignment.

That same year, the administrators of Bakley’s estate filed a civil wrongful death suit against Robert Blake, seeking unspecified damages on behalf of Bakley’s four children.

In March of 2005, Robert Blake was acquitted of the murder of Bakley in the criminal proceedings, but was found liable in the wrongful death civil suit brought by Bakley’s children. The actor was ordered to pay $30 million in damages to her family. The amount of damages awarded to Bakley’s children was later reduced to $15 million after Robert Blake’s lawyers appealed the civil suit, but the Los Angeles court upheld the wrongful death verdict.

In 2011, Robert Blake published a memoir titled “Tales of a Rascal: What I Did for Love.” He appeared on CNN in an interview with Piers Morgan in 2012 to promote the book and accused Morgan of calling him a “liar” when questioned about Bakley’s murder.

He maintained his innocence in connection to the murder of his wife.

Gerry Schwartzbach, who represented Robert Blake during the trial, told CNN in a statement that the actor “was a complicated man.”

“He and I spent parts of virtually every day together over the year I lived in LA working on his case. We had a strong bond,” the attorney said. “I am saddened by his passing, but glad that he is no longer suffering.”

According to his family’s statement, in recent years, Robert Blake lived quietly in the Los Angeles area. In lieu of flowers, his family requests that donations be made to City of Hope.

“Stranger Things” star Grace Van Dien says she’s been declining acting roles after experiencing sexual harassment on set.

The 26-year-old actress, best known for playing cheerleader Chrissy Cunningham in the Netflix sci-fi drama, addressed her decision to be more selective this week during a Twitch live stream, saying ” the last few projects I’ve worked on I didn’t have the best experiences with some of the people I had to work for.”

Van Dien went on to recount a particular incident, in which an unnamed film producer allegedly propositioned her on set.

“One of the last movies I did, one of the producers asked me to… like, he hired a girl that he was sleeping with and then he had her ask me to have a threesome with them,” Van Dien said. “So… like, that’s my boss. And then I didn’t and I cried and I was so upset.”

Van Dien shared that she’s focusing on streaming for now because she gets to “choose who I hang out with, who I talk to.”

On Thursday, Van Dien tweeted that her professional priorities are changing.

“As I get older, my work priorities are changing,” she told her 231,000 Twitter followers. “I’m waiting for the right project/the right people to work with. 🎥🤍”

She added: “it’s nice to feel calm.”

CNN has contacted Van Dien’s representatives for further comment.

Before her breakout role in “Stranger Things”, Van Dien, who is the daughter of “Starship Troopers” actor Casper Van Dien, appeared on TV shows such as “The Village” and “Greenhouse Academy.” Her film credits include “V for Vengeance” and “What Comes Around.”

Van Dien, who regularly streams herself playing games like “Fortnite” and “Overwatch” on Twitch under the handle @BlueFille, has 293,000 followers on the platform.CNN —

If the last “Scream” movie made noise by wedding the old with the new, “Scream VI” reinforces how shrewd the producers were in casting the next generation, with Melissa Barrera and Jenna Ortega ably carrying this chapter of horror’s most self-referential franchise. Throw in a new venue and the same old thrills and kills, and Paramount should be slashing all the way to the bank.

The ad campaign makes a little too much, in a “Start spreading the news” kind of way, of shifting the action to New York City. While that does provide some fresh wrinkles (on the subway, no one can hear you you-know-what), slicing and dicing up the Big Apple doesn’t do anything significant to shake up the basic formula.

Fortunately, the city that never sleeps is now home to Tara (Ortega, red hot from her “Wednesday” role), who’s attending college there, and her sister Sam (“In the Heights’” Barrera), who is keeping a watchful eye over her sibling, including her willingness to tase anyone who might invade her space.

The central quartet also includes holdovers and fellow Woodsboro survivors Chad (Mason Gooding) and Mindy (Jasmin Savoy Brown), the latter being the keeper of the “We’re going to recite the rules” monologue. A year has passed since their last adventure with a killer Ghostface, which has left everyone with an understandable case of “trust issues.”

Although Neve Campbell sits out this latest film, Courteney Cox returns along with Hayden Panettiere, which mostly serves as an excuse for a wide assortment of callbacks and winks toward “Screams” past. Still, given the focus on the younger contingent, the baton feels as if it has been passed.

As usual, the fewer questions asked the better, starting with how much blood someone can lose from multiple stab wounds and still be ambulatory. But enough of the jokes land to tickle hard-core fans, and the producers did themselves an enormous favor with the pairing of Barrera and Ortega, who bring just the right mix of eyebrow-arched cynicism, genuine chemistry and last-girl badassery to their sister act.

Directors Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett return to the helm, and despite the limits associated with this sort of exercise, their affection for the franchise is clearly evident.

After three “Scream” movies in four years starting in 1996, the franchise took a break until 2011 (then featuring Panettiere), with a similar gap until last year’s revival.

Although the layoff helps explain the enthusiasm that greeted “V,” it’s naïve to think “Scream” will again experience lengthy periods of dormancy. Because for a franchise that likes to talk about the rules of horror, they don’t articulate the bottom-line consideration here: That is, as long as you can keep reliably luring people to theaters, there’s not a ghost of a chance that you’ll be gone for long, any more than you need to worry about running out of bodies or Roman numerals.

Jennifer Lawrence is going full on comedy.

Sony has released the trailer for her forthcoming movie, “No Hard Feelings.” In the film, Lawrence plays a woman named Maggie, who in order to save her home, takes a job that entails trying to seduce a shy 19-year-old.

The R-rated trailer is NSFW (though it may depend on where you work) and opens with Lawrence having some financial issues before she answers an ad from some helicopter parents looking to bring their son out of his shell.

Upon meeting the young man, Percy, played by Andrew Barth Feldman at a pet adoption center she asks him, “Mind if I touch your wiener?” as he cradles a Dachshund, which are known as wiener dogs.

See what they did there?

Lawrence is one of the producers for the project, which also stars Matthew Broderick. The comedy is directed by Gene Stupnitsky.

Queer icon RuPaul says the slew of new legislation throughout the country looking to restrict or prohibit drag show performances is the work of “bullies.”

In an Instagram Reel posted to RuPaul’s verified account on Wednesday, the Emmy-winner said the anti-drag bills are “a classic distraction technique” turning the focus away from the real issues that lawmakers were voted into office to tackle.

Those real issues, RuPaul said, are job security, healthcare and “keeping our children safe from harm at their own school.”

“But we know that bullies are incompetent at solving real issues,” RuPaul said. “They look for easy targets so they can give the impression of being effective. They think our love, our light, our laughter and our joy are signs of weakness. But they’re wrong, because that is our strength.”

RuPaul is host of “RuPaul’s Drag Race,” a drag competition show that has been on the air since 2009 and won 26 Primetime Emmys. The show is often credited for bringing awareness of drag performance to a larger audience and, in turn, helping destigmatize the LGBTQ+ community.

RuPaul went on to say that drag queens “are the Marines of the queer movement.”

“Don’t get it twisted and don’t be distracted,” RuPaul added, before urging people to register to vote “so we can get these stunt queens out of office and put some smart people with real solutions into government.”

The TV personality’s statements come as anti-drag bills in at least 11 states across the country are working their way through legislatures, according to a CNN review.

The bills are being pushed forth mostly in Republican-led states. Politicians in those states claim drag performances expose children to sexual themes and imagery that are inappropriate.

The claim has been rejected by advocates, who say the proposed measures are discriminatory against the LGBTQ community and could violate First Amendment laws.CNN —

Jenna Ortega’s first order of business as the next host of “Saturday Night Live” is to escape the “teenage purgatory” of performing the iconic “Wednesday” dance yet again.

In a new “SNL” promo released on Wednesday, of course, Ortega looks at a script as she speaks to Ben Marshall, John Higgins and Martin Herlihy, the Please Don’t Destroy Boys comedy trio.

“Honestly, this is really well written, I just don’t feel like I want to do the ‘Wednesday’ dance for promo because we’ve seen so much of that already and I think it’s time to do something new,” Ortega says.

The PDD Boys agree with Ortega, until the camera pans out to reveal they’re dressed “down to the frill” in Wednesday Addams-inspired black dresses and braided wigs. After pretending like they don’t know the “Wednesday” dance at all and had no intention of filming it for the promo, Ortega finally agrees to go along with their poorly masked desire to indeed do the dance.

In true Wednesday Addams fashion, Ortega stoically performs a snippet of the dance on the iconic “SNL” stage in between Higgins and Marshall while Herlihy captures the moment on a smartphone.

The “Wednesday” dance took on a life of its own when it went viral on social media after the scene appeared in the Netflix show late last year.

The “SNL” promo comes on the heels of an interview in which Ortega spoke about how she’d frequently change her character’s lines during “Wednesday’s” production, which spurred mixed reactions from those in the television industry.

“SNL” airs live Saturday at 11:30pm EST/8:30pm PST on NBC and streams live on Peacock. Ortega is this week’s host with The 1975 as the musical guest.CNN —

Lukas Gage is aware people are wondering if he is dating celebrity hairstylist Chris Appleton.

Everyone can keep wondering for now.

In an interview with the New York Times, it was noted that the 27-year-old “White Lotus” star had just returned from vacationing in Mexico with Appleton, 39.

The interviewer pointed out that some people took the social media photos they posted of their vacay “as a relationship announcement,” to which Gage replied, “If they want to think that, they can.”

“I’m a pretty open book about most things in my life, but I have a problem with the culture of everyone needing to know everybody’s business and nothing can be sacred,” he said. ” It’s a weird line that I’m still trying to figure out.”

He was more open about his desire to land a role on the hit Netflix series, “You,” which he eventually did as he currently stars in Season 4.

“I think I had auditioned for every single season of “You” and didn’t get it until then. I auditioned for [star Penn Badgley’s serial killer character] Joe originally,” Gage said. “[I] played him like a mustache-twirling, villainous murderer, and the casting director was like, ‘Yeah, that’s totally tonally off, but thank you.’”"It Happened One Night" (1935): "It Happened One Night" was one of the great underdog winners. Its studio, Columbia, wasn't considered one of the majors at the time, and neither Clark Gable nor Claudette Colbert, its stars, were excited about the project. But it became the first film to sweep the five major categories of picture, actor, actress, director and screenplay. To this day, only two other films -- "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" (1975) and "The Silence of the Lambs" (1991) -- have pulled off the same trick. Columbia Pictures CorporationCNN —

Adam Driver has his fans, but he seems determined to test their loyalty with some of his recent film choices, the sci-fi thriller “65” being the latest among them. Although the title refers to how many million years ago Driver’s character visits Earth – encountering dinosaurs when he gets there – it could just as easily denote the score the movie earns on a scale of one to 200.

Driver still looks pretty human, but he’s actually an alien from long ago named Mills, who undertakes an exploratory mission before his spacecraft is struck by an asteroid and crash lands on Earth. The only other survivor is an orphaned young girl, Koa (Ariana Greenblatt), which, shades of “The Last of Us,” resonates because Mills left an ailing child behind when he embarked on the journey.

Koa essentially serves one basic purpose, giving Mills someone to talk to (even if they don’t speak the same language) and rescue from the jaws of hungry dinosaurs, as they schlep across the perilous landscape toward their one possible means of escape.

Adam Driver and Ariana Greenblatt stars in "65." Patti Perret/CTMG, Inc./Sony Pictures

Written and directed by the team of Scott Beck and Bryan Woods (whose writing credits include “A Quiet Place”), “65” somehow manages to include a lot of dinosaurs and still be fairly boring. Much of that has to do with the fact that practically every beat of the film is wildly predictable, including the arbitrary deadline the duo faces in terms of finding a way home.

Driver certainly remains much in demand for leading-man roles, and he has exhibited an eclectic appetite in that regard. Yet after his Oscar-nominated turn in “Marriage Story” the tale of the tape has been pretty bleak, including “Annette,” “House of Gucci,” “White Noise” and now this tepid thrill ride, raising the question of whether it’s time for him to become a bit more choosy.

Charitably, “65” can be viewed as an old-fashioned throwback to the kind of “B” movies that flourished about 65 years ago, just graced with the modern techniques now available for bringing ancient creatures to life.

That said, there’s a reason such films have, in theatrical terms, been pushed to the brink of extinction, and “65” represents such an uninspired effort as to look like a fossil even before the credits roll.

Over a career spanning four decades, Michelle Yeoh has been disarming audiences with her physical prowess as a martial artist and her emotive talent as an actor.

While she became an international icon 23 years ago, thanks to Ang Lee’s Oscar-winning “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,” it wasn’t until last year’s “Everything Everywhere All at Once” that she gained recognition from the Academy with her first Oscar nomination.

Here is a look back at some of Yeoh’s career highlights.

‘Yes, Madam!’ (1985)

A formidable entry in Yeoh’s early years of making movies in Hong Kong, this rock-‘em-sock-‘em action film is notable for its prominent placement of female actors rising up against the baddies, clearly paving the way for later opuses like Quentin Tarantino’s “Kill Bill” saga. “Yes, Madam!” is also a fun time capsule, maintaining a slightly goofy tone while featuring Yeoh in a pixie cut and giant ’80s shoulderpads.

‘Supercop’ (1992)

Yeoh shows off her martial-arts skills in this Hong Kong action-comedy opposite Jackie Chan, which received a dubbed release in the US. She played an Interpol inspector, and her role included truly harrowing stunt work – such as landing a motorcycle on a moving train, and in a few takes, dangerously skidding off of it – that was shown during the closing credits.

‘Wing Chun’ (1994)

A somewhat more stoic but still kinetic action-packed martial arts movie, it’s plain to see how “Wing Chun” allowed Yeoh to soar in the later classic “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.” It also marks one of Yeoh’s superior collaborations with legendary director and stuntman Woo-Ping Yuen, with whom she later worked on “Dragon” and other titles.

‘Tomorrow Never Dies’ (1997)

Yeoh played one of the most powerful Bond women, an equal to 007 in terms of smarts and strength. Much was made at the time of Yeoh – a former beauty queen-turned-actress – doing her own stunts in the Pierce Brosnan-starring film, as she kicked butt and won acclaim.

‘Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon’ (2000)

A dazzling international hit, memorable to many for its graceful wire-work action sequences, from director Ang Lee. Yeoh co-starred opposite Chow Yun-fat as two warriors unable to express their love for each other, with Zhang Ziyi as the thief they must battle for the possession a fabled centuries-old sword known as the Green Destiny.

‘Memoirs of a Geisha’ (2005)

Adapted from Arthur Golden’s novel, the story begins in the late 1920s, with Yeoh as Mameha, a fierce matriarch who schools her young protégé, Chiyo (again Zhang Ziyi) in the ways of serving as a geisha. The movie did generate some controversy at the time for casting non-Japanese actors, including Yeoh and Zhang, in the most prominent roles but their performances were praised.

‘The Lady’ (2011)

Based on the true story of Aung San Suu Kyi, Burmese politician and Nobel Peace Prize laureate, “The Lady” was a tour de force for Yeoh in the role of someone who stood up to violence and oppression. Directed by Luc Besson and costarring David Thewlis, the film is also a touching love story, earning Yeoh a best actress nomination for a Satellite Award.

‘Crazy Rich Asians’ (2018)

Yeoh portrayed a mother not to be played with in this 2018 film, the first major Hollywood movie to feature a majority Asian cast in 25 years (coming after “The Joy Luck Club” in 1993). Her character Eleanor Young is the sophisticated and tough-as-nails mom to main character Nick (Henry Golding), whose choice of girlfriend, Rachel (Constance Wu), Eleanor is less than thrilled with. She also plays a mean game of mahjong.

‘Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings’ (2021)

Yeoh joined the Marvel Cinematic Universe in the most graceful of styles, playing a mystical warrior who showed just how much of a dance martial-arts combat can really be. As the guardian of the magical realm known as Ta Lo, Yeoh’s whimsical character Ying Nan taught the men in the film, including Simu Liu’s titular hero Shang Chi, that success is not only borne from brute strength.CNN —

Pedro Pascal can handle the heat from a hot wing, but the summer sun on the “Games of Thrones” set was another story.

Before the actor was dodging mushroom zombies in “The Last of Us,” Pascal played Dornish heartthrob Oberyn Martell in Season 4 of “Game Of Thrones,” a character who infamously gets his eyes gouged out by Gregor “The Mountain” Clegane (Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson).

Barbaric as it was to watch, the “Mandalorian” star remembers it as “the best part of the day” in a new episode of hot wing interview show “Hot Ones.”

Pascal told “Hot Ones” host Sean Evans that he ended up falling “dead asleep” when filming the edge-of-your-seat moment. (“Game of Thrones” and “The Last of Us” are HBO shows. CNN and HBO are both part of the same parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery.)

(From left) Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson and Pedro Pascal in 'Game of Thrones.' HBO

“It was so hot when we were shooting that scene. He’s over me and he puts his thumbs into my eyes and they’ve got tubing through his body into his forearms to his thumbs just pumping this cool blood,” he said, adding that Björnsson was “the gentlest guy ever.”

Pascal said that the fake blood was “so cooling,” that when it was pumped all over his face “it was very cathartic and I went into the deepest sleep I’d been in.”

One good thing that came from this scene for Pascal is perhaps figuring out a sleep remedy.

“I realize now, because I’m not a very good sleeper, I need to be laid out with pieces of flesh, gelatinous, cool-to-the-touch face meat and pooling blood, and maybe I’ll finally get a good f**king night’s sleep,” the actor joked while taking in the heat of the chicken wing he was eating.

On second thought, maybe he should try counting sheep instead.CNN —

Grateful Academy Award recipients will once again be battling the clock on Sunday night as they give their acceptance speeches. And the men behind that timer – and the inevitable music that follows when it reaches zero – are prepared to make some tough calls.

Ahead of the Oscars, executive producers and showrunners Ricky Kirshner and Glenn Weiss said in an interview with CNN that trying to control the length of thank you speeches is a responsibility they take seriously.

“If you are giving a heartfelt, well-meaning speech, you will not get cut off,” Kirshner said. “If you start reading off your grocery list of what you need to do tomorrow, probably the music’s gonna come in.”

He likened himself and Weiss to a “coach and a quarterback,” saying that they “are on headsets all night, we kind of have a feel.” The pair have worked together for two decades, helming various big-tickets events between the two of them – from the Super Bowl Halftime show, to the Tonys, to past Academy Awards shows.

There are times, of course, when even the music can’t stop a winner from trying to make the most of their moment. On those instances, Kirshner said he has strong feelings.

“To be honest, it’s kind of rude to the people that come after,” he said. “We’re all professionals trying to do our job.”

He added: “We’re not trying to be rude.”

The battle over time on the awards stage is nothing new, but the ire has seemed louder than usual at times. At the Golden Globes in January, pianist Chloe Flower received backlash online – and even from award recipients – for playing the piano when she was instructed to. She clarified on Twitter, “I would never play piano over people’s speeches!! I’m only playing when you see me on camera!”

At the Oscars, Weiss said, a countdown clock helps winners keep track of time, and when it is up, words appear on the teleprompter asking them to “Please wrap it up.”

That’s when other measures need to be taken.

“Nobody – to say it clearly – wants to play music,” he said. “We hope that everyone respects (the time allotted), and if everybody does, there’s no music playing.”

As for other unscripted moments – whether it’s something small and silly like Ariana DeBose’s BAFTAs rap or major like last year’s infamous Oscars slap – Weiss and Kirshner along with their production team are trying to be prepared for practically anything that may happen during the telecast.

“We really do believe that what happens in the room translates on television,” Kirshner said. “Things happen. And that’s why we’re (working) in live television – because we love that.”CNN —

Steve Carell’s final days as Dunder Mifflin’s branch manager spanned a spectrum of emotions for the actor.

Carell played Michael Scott for seven seasons on the hit NBC documentary-style comedy before exiting the show in 2011, two seasons before the show’s series finale aired in 2013, and he said his farewell episode was tough to shoot.

“It was a really difficult episode to do but I also loved it at the same time because it was the end game for Michael,” Carell told his former “Office” co-stars Angela Kinsey and Jenna Fischer on Wednesday’s episode of their podcast “The Office Ladies.”

In the show, Carell’s Scott ends up leaving Dunder Mifflin for love, moving from Scranton, Pennsylvania to be with his on-screen fiancée, Holly Flax (Amy Ryan), in Colorado.

On this week’s podcast, Carell said that Scott’s departure “was the culmination showing the growth that he didn’t need the big sendoff, he didn’t need the big party. He could say goodbye to all of his friends on his own terms without the fanfare. I really enjoyed having that character evolve to that point in that moment.”

Rainn Wilson, who played fan-favorite character Dwight Schrute, told EW in 2011 that filming Carell’s final episode was “intense.”

“There actually wasn’t a dry eye in the house,” Wilson said, adding that “it was very difficult to make comedy when there was a heaviness hanging over the proceedings.”

Even though the sendoff was “emotional” for Carell, he told Fischer and Kinsey on the podcast that his tears were those of joy and that he wasn’t sad to leave, but rather he was “ready to go.”

“It was time for other characters to step to the forefront and other storylines to be pursued. The timing was right for everybody,” he said. “But simultaneously, there was just a sense of joy that we had experienced all of this. I was getting a chance to take a lap with everybody. I was simultaneously saying goodbye as Michael and us as friends in this moment of work together.”

During the show’s run, Carell led the 2007 movie “Dan in Real Life” and went on to star in other notable films after leaving “The Office,” such as “Foxcatcher” in 2014 – which earned him an Oscar nomination for best actor – and “The Big Short” the following year.

Kinsey said the reality of Carell’s departure came in “waves” and that they alternated between laughing and tearing up while filming his final episode.

While Carell was absent from appearing in Season 8 and Season 9, he did make a surprise uncredited appearance in “The Office’s” series finale in 2013 when he stood in as Dwight’s best man at his wedding.

“I think you can see it when you watch the show, there is a calm to it,” he said. “Everyone is loving each other in terms of us as actors and people beyond the characters.”CNN —

Goldie Hawn has enjoyed a vibrant career in Hollywood, but she admits she has at least one “regret.”

The star, who won an Oscar in 1970 for her role in 1969’s “Cactus Flower” but was unable to attend the ceremony, told Variety in an interview published on Wednesday that she wishes she’d gotten the full experience of winning the prestigious award.

“I never got dressed up. I never got to pick up the award,” she said. “I regret it.”

At the time, Hawn was in London sleeping, in preparation for an early call time for her next film.

The “Overboard” actress told the publication that she “forgot it was on television that night,” waking up when a reporter called in the early morning hours to seek her comment on winning.

After she hung up, she called her parents and “had a good cry.”

Fast forward to 2023, the star, now 77, said she only just recently saw footage from that particular Oscars telecast, and was surprised to see who read her name that night. Hawn said her friend Jimmy Kimmel – who is set to host this year’s Academy Awards on Sunday – asked her a few weeks ago if she ever saw “the part where you’re being announced by Fred Astaire?”

“‘Fred Astaire?!’” she remembered replying. “He’s my idol. And I didn’t know he was the one that announced my name. I got emotional when I finally saw it.”

Hawn graces the cover of the new issue of Variety.

Her most recent credit was in the film “The Christmas Chronicles: Part Two,” in which she stars alongside real-life partner Kurt Russell as Mrs. Claus and Santa Claus, respectively.CNN —

Watch out Deadpool, Wolverine is coming for you.

Hugh Jackman posted on his verified Instagram account photos of the meals he is eating to get ready to reprise his role as Wolverine, this time in “Deadpool 3,” opposite Ryan Reynolds.

“Bulking. A day in the life,” the caption on the photos reads. “Thank you Chef Mario for helping me stay healthy and properly fed whilst … Becoming. Wolverine. Again.”

The meals include black bass, chicken burgers, salmon and grass-fed sirloins.

The “X-Men” star recently told CNN’s Chris Wallace during an interview on “Who’s Talking to Chris Wallace” that he did not use steroids to achieve his cut, superhero physique, but rather “just did it the old school way.”

“And I tell you, I’ve eaten more chickens — I’m so sorry to all the vegans and vegetarians and to the chickens of the world,” Jackman said. “Literally the karma is not good for me. If the deity has anything related to chickens, I’m in trouble.”

Lisa Vanderpump was as shocked by the “Vanderpump Rules” cheating scandal as everyone else.

During an appearance Wednesday on “Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen,” Vanderpump said she was blindsided by news that cast members Tom Sandoval and Raquel Leviss had carried on a affair behind the back of Sandoval’s now ex-girlfriend, Ariana Madix.

“Gobsmacked, flabbergasted,” Vanderpump said when Cohen asked her reaction to the revelation. “I mean literally no words. I didn’t see it coming, nobody saw it coming.”

The controversy has been the talk of viewers of the show that bears her name. Vanderpump said she has seen Madix and filmed with her since the news broke. “Obviously, it’s an integral part of the story now,” she said.

“I would say the word I would use is ‘devastated,” Vanderpump said in expressing how Madix is doing. “A lot of tears. Ariana was always that ride or die girlfriend… it seems like Raquel was the ‘ride’ girlfriend [Ariana] was the ‘die’ girlfriend.”

The scandal has rocked the audience considering Leviss and Madix had been portrayed as close friends on the show, and Sandoval and Madix were a long-time couple.

Both Leviss and Sandoval have issued public apologies to Madix via social media.

Late Wednesday, Leviss also shared a statement on her verified Instagram account about the current status of her relationship with Sandoval, writing, “Besides the indefensible circumstances surrounding our relationship, my feelings for Tom have always been sincere and born out of a loving friendship.”

“Knowing how many people we hurt, I need to understand my choices and learn to make better ones,” the statement read. I need to take care of my health, work on self growth and take time to be ok with being alone.”

“I care for Tom and I don’t want to label anything or predict what lies ahead,” she added. “Right now I need to heal.”

Chris Evans and Ana de Armas are back in action.

Four years after co-starring in the 2019 murder mystery “Knives Out,” the actors have teamed back up in the Apple TV+ movie “Ghosted,” where they have to work their way out of a romantic gesture gone awry.

The trailer for “Ghosted” dropped on Monday and shows Evans and de Armas’s initial meet-cute, leading to what appears to be a hopeful first date.

“I know this sounds crazy but I think she might be the one,” Evans tells a friend in the trailer.

That hope fizzles once Evans comes to terms with the possibility that he’s been ghosted, a term used to describe a scenario in which a person cuts off communication without any explanation.

Evans then finds himself in London after a character, played by Amy Sedaris, urges him to “go to her.”

Once overseas, Evans learns his dream girl’s life is more complicated than he initially thought. After getting kidnapped and subsequently rescued by de Armas, she reveals she’s with the CIA. Chaos ensues as the couple is seen jumping out of a plane, traversing what looks like a deserted island and dodging bullets while dressed to the nines.

“You got me kidnapped and tortured all after one date,” Evans says to de Armas.

“You’re the one who flew to London,” de Armas replies.

De Armas has been busy lately. The “Blonde” actress was nominated for her first best actress Oscar for her role in the Marilyn Monroe biopic that started streaming on Netflix last year. Evans’ most recent project was the 2022 Netflix movie “The Gray Man.”

“Ghosted” will be available to stream on Apple TV+ on April 20.CNN —

When it comes to “Ted Lasso,” the show is often all-consuming for Jason Sudeikis.

As co-creator, executive producer and star of the hit Apple+ series, Sudeikis is always thinking about the show, its plot and characters, he tells CNN.

“This is literally what I do every day,” Sudeikis says. “I didn’t edit during production just because it was just too big of a load to carry with the writing and the acting, but then you know, being a producer, I was there on set every day going behind-the-scenes with notes, supporting our directors and our DP’s. When I go and watch, editing now, it’s a thrill. That’s a credit to the work that the writers did, but then also the way these actors portray them.”

Sudeikis says he shows up to set “excited to see” what the creative team on the series will pull off. The third and final season of “Ted Lasso,” which premieres on March 15, will delve even more into the characters’ backgrounds, Sudeikis adds, with inspiration coming from everywhere. For instance, he likes to encourage the cast to incorporate their real-life skills and talents into their characters.

“You know every person [on the show] has added something to it,” he says. “Sometimes it’s just what you hear people talking about, or a conversation I’ve had off-camera. An example of that would be Jeremy Swift, who plays Higgins, he and I are talking about music one day and he’s explaining to me his passion for jazz, now he plays standup bass, and I’m kinda like, ‘Oh, I think Higgins is gonna get his goatee back, his jazz goatee, and he’s gonna play that bass.’ And that’s just something I learned at Second City in Chicago, where you’re writing a show as an actor.”

Other times, “you stay open to it and just let the universe sort of lead the way,” he says.

Jason Sudeikis in "Ted Lasso." Season 3 debuts on Apple TV+ later this month. Apple TV+

Many ideas for “Ted Lasso,” Sudeikis says, have arrived in ways that he “couldn’t articulate.”

“It feels indulgent to say that, but I say it humbly,” he says. “It’s what athletes call ‘The Zone,’ it’s a real thing. And sometimes we only feel it in the 20 seconds when we first get in the shower.”

After that, he says, “we remember all there is to worry about,” in life.

Sudeikis says the show coming to a conclusion this season is bittersweet. He’s aware of a desire among viewers of the comedy for more.

“I look at that enthusiasm for [another season], which is not at all in existence or moving towards existence as of now, to be flattering,” he says. “We all do. But I also am like still, you know, eyes deep in season three. We’re still worried about this and going episode to episode. I didn’t know we were gonna get to do three seasons. None of us knew that this thing was going to take off the way it did, and people were going to respond to it the way they did.”

So is he saying there’s a chance for more folksy, observational wisdom from Ted in the future?

“If that which seemed impossible became possible, then maybe even the impossible can become possible,” Sudeikis replies.

Just when you thought Keanu Reeves couldn’t be any cooler.

During a recent Reddit Ask-Me-Anything (AMA), Reeves was asked if he had ever stolen anything from any of his many movie sets.

“Not stolen… the watch and wedding ring from John Wick, a sword from 47 Ronin, and the first red pill that the Wachowski’s ever gave me,” Reeves replied.

Yes, that means Reeves took the red pill from “The Matrix.”

The actor is currently promoting his latest “John Wick” film, the fourth in the franchise.

Both “The Matrix” franchise and the “John Wick” one have some overlap when it comes to the physicality. Both involved martial arts and Reeves was asked about the action.

“Nothing can ever compare to the kung fu training from the Matrix because it was so unique and my first time…but the jiu jitsu in John Wick being integrated with judo and gunfights can never be touched in its own way,” he said.

Reeves also answered a question about his aspirations had he not gotten into acting.

“Well, when I was a kid I always said I wanted to be a race car driver, a conductor or an astrophysicist,” he said. “Today, let’s conduct some music.”

Just don’t ask him his favorite film in which he has starred.

“I’ve been very fortunate to work on a few films that have changed my life. I can’t pick just one,” Reeves said. “But here are a few- ‘River’s Edge,’ ‘Bill and Ted’s Excellent Adventure,’ ‘Matrix’ trilogy, ‘The Devil’s Advocate,’ ‘A Scanner Darkly,’ ‘My Own Private Idaho,’ ‘Point Break,’ ‘John Wick’.CNN —

The success of last year’s “Janet Jackson” documentary means there’s more to come.

Lifetime and A&E announced Wednesday that the networks have greenlit a continuation of the story of the superstar’s life and career.

According to the networks, “Janet Jackson: Family First” will “chronicle the legendary singer, songwriter, producer, author, actor, philanthropist and global icon as she embarks on her 2023 “Together Again” tour, and her collaboration with brother Randy Jackson to reunite the family band after 40 years since their last performance.”

“Janet Jackson” was deemed a success after it was seen by 21 million viewers last year.

“I was touched by the love and support from the wonderful fans who enjoyed the documentary,” Jackson said in a statement. “I am excited to continue to share my story, and welcome fans into my life and the ‘Together Again’ tour. Thank you for your never-ending support, and I hope you enjoy the next chapter.”

The new documentary is currently filming and will follow the 2023 “Together Again” tour, which will celebrate Janet Jackson’s 50th anniversary in entertainment. It will also spotlight the milestones for two of Jackson’s most critically acclaimed albums – 25 years of “The Velvet Rope,” and 30 years of “janet.”CNN —

The Oscars are considered the highlight of awards season, but its categories are so rigid – best actress? Best costuming? How about freakiest killer doll nightmare and best performance by a donkey? We at CNN’s culture desk are honoring the best and most memorable movies of the year with our own awards that the Academy Awards won’t touch.

Best performance by a miniature pack animal

Jenny the Donkey as Jenny the Donkey in “The Banshees of Inisherin”

Maybe you were most moved by Colin Farrell’s tragic performance as an earnest dullard who loses his only human friend in the world in “Banshees,” or maybe you fell for Barry Keoghan’s even more tragic village idiot. But the film belongs to Jenny, Farrell’s beloved miniature donkey whom he allows to sleep inside against his sister’s wishes. She’s got spunk in spades, and her arc is perhaps the most devastating in a film full of suffering. (The authors of this piece did not see the donkey-led drama “EO,” up for best international feature at the Oscars, because they can only take so much trauma.)

Best running joke (?)

Austin Butler’s unrelenting “Elvis” accent

This is a man from Anaheim, California, who speaks not with a chill West Coast affect but with the syrupy drawl of a man born in Tupelo, Mississippi, and raised in Tennessee. Butler disappeared so fully into the role of one Elvis Presley that he can’t find his way back out, and so every acceptance speech he’s delivered this awards season is marked by the same inexplicable Southern accent. Never mind that “Elvis” finished filming years ago and was released more than eight months ago. (“Elvis” was released by Warner Bros., which like CNN, is a unit of Warner Bros. Discovery.)

Best arms

The Agojie, “The Woman King”

We don’t mean weapons – the cast of “The Woman King” hardly needs them. While their enemies fight with muskets, the women warriors of Dahomey – known as the Agojie – rely heavily on their impressive strength (aided by the occasional machete, spear or dangerously sharp fingernail). Viola Davis, Lashana Lynch, Thuso Mbedu and their co-stars got strong in real life to play the formidable members of the Agojie, and they receive ample screentime to show off their enviable muscle. The men of Marvel who bulk up for every movie have nothing on the cast of “The Woman King.”

Best dance sequence

TIE: Paul Mescal in “Aftersun” and “Naatu Naatu” in “RRR”

“Under Pressure” never sounded as emotionally shattering as it did in “Aftersun,” when Paul Mescal as a mercurial young father finally lets loose on the dance floor. His moves embarrass his preteen daughter at first, until she finally relents and dances with him, clinging tightly. It’s a cathartic, bittersweet moment in a film whose heartbreaking ending is telegraphed from the start.

Meanwhile, in the runaway hit from India, “RRR,” a massive mob of extras break out into a raucous and joyous dance sequence set to “Naatu Naatu.” The song became the earworm of awards season – apologies to Lady Gaga and Rihanna, who also made admirable attempts with their original songs (and, like the artists behind “Naatu Naatu,” earned Oscar noms this year).

Best use of rocks

“Everything Everywhere All At Once”

Admit it, you heard sniffles in the theater during the rock scene – when Michelle Yeoh’s Evelyn confronts her daughter/multiversal nemesis (Stephanie Hsu) while they’re small stones, overlooking the Grand Canyon. As rocks, they discuss the unending vastness of the universe and how meaningless it can make their lives feel. For a film whose props include hot dog fingers and puppet raccoons, it’s a deep idea to ponder. Who knew throwing some googly eyes on a glorified pebble could make even the most stoic among us weep?

Best whale

“Avatar: The Way of Water”

Disney

OK, so the Tulkun in James Cameron’s “Avatar” sequel are not exactly whales as we know them, but the massive water-dwelling creatures are the closest species Pandora has to Earth’s largest mammal. Even if you weren’t enchanted by the latest chapter of Jake Sully’s Na’vi adventures, chances are you were still moved by the death of the first-time mom Tulkun who composed songs. There is, of course, another whale film in contention this year, but these authors decline to comment further.

Best ‘dandy on vacation’ wardrobe

Daniel Craig’s leisurewear in “Glass Onion”

The culprit behind the murder in “Knives Out” followup “Glass Onion” was plain to see from the jump, but Daniel Craig’s Southern detective Benoit Blanc was anything but plainly dressed in the island-set romp. Speaking of romps, Craig sported an especially memorable blue-and-white vertical striped romper with a citrine ascot and sensible sandals in a pool-side scene. His summertime casual attire was the highlight of an otherwise middling mystery.

Best onscreen food

Cheeseburger, “The Menu”

Though neither writer is particularly fond of cheese or red meat, we, too, would take a Shake Shack knock-off over broken emulsions, tortillas featuring our tax records and, of course, the threat of death. Plus, it’s not every day that a cheeseburger saves you from getting burned alive with your imbecile of a date and a bunch of pretentious rich people. What other menu item can say that?

Best AI-fueled nightmare

“M3gan”

A horror movie about a murderous AI doll being released at the same time AI-powered ChatGPT is all over the news and Bing’s AI chatbox admits its secret desire to spread misinformation is enough to make us want to press restart on this whole planet. If we learned one thing from “M3gan,” it’s that we should leave AI in sci-fi novels.

Best buddy to brave an alien invasion with

Keke Palmer in “Nope”

Keke Palmer was the effervescent highlight of "Nope," Jordan Peele's third film. Universal Pictures

The award says it all. From the second Palmer marches onscreen in “Nope,” she had us in shambles – deftly toeing the line between boisterous younger sister and cunning entrepreneur. “Nope” isn’t even a comedy, but every line and bewildered expression from Palmer was a delight. If the aliens ever do choose to make a visit, may we have Palmer at our side.

Best attempt at a provocative statement

“Tár”

Cate Blanchett in "Tár" -- was it an allegory? A faux-biopic? A diatribe against cancel culture? Or just another Oscar vehicle for one of the greatest actresses of our time? Courtesy of Focus Features

Were we supposed to feel bad for Cate Blanchett’s Lydia Tár, a renowned conductor whose life falls apart in the midst of sexual misconduct allegations? Were we meant to laugh when she bullies a student, a self-described “BIPOC pangender person”? And, if so, is it at her cutting comments or at the student’s buzzword-laden self-description? We aren’t really sure!!!!! “Tár” is, we think, trying to say something, but months later, we still don’t know what. And that in itself is truly a triumph.

Best blonde

Andrea Riseborough, “To Leslie”

There were multiple blondes vying for this category, but our hearts led us to surprise nominee Riseborough and her messy blonde mop with grown-out roots. We know some may think a certain Marilyn Monroe rendition deserved this title, but half of Hollywood wanted Riseborough to win in this specific category for this specific CNN Faux-Oscars Awards. And who are we to deny the people?

Best pro-war movie

“Top Gun: Maverick”

We can’t lie, watching “Top Gun: Maverick” did make us wonder if we should switch careers and become fighter pilots. Like, come on, you get to fly super fast while also playing football on the beach with all your newfound best friends? Plus you get a cool nickname?? Sign us up.

Best anti-war movie

“All Quiet on the Western Front”

The intense German film left no stone unturned when it came to the horrors of war, even when we wished it did. (Did we really need to see that man blow up??? Did we??) Though brutal, this adaptation of the classic novel did present a harrowing look at life as a soldier in WWI, while also reminding us to brush up on our AP World History. Get you a girl who can do both!

Best emotional roller coaster

“Black Panther: Wakanda Forever”

This movie has everything. In mere minutes, you’re crying with Shuri (Letitia Wright) over the death of her brother, gasping as Ramonda (Angela Bassett) snaps at Europeans trying to steal vibranium, and giggling at Mbaku’s (Winston Duke) quips. “Black Panther” is nearly three hours of up and down and up and down and up again. We wouldn’t have it any other way.

Best menstrual metaphor

“Turning Red”

A Pixar movie that presents periods as a regular part of growing up and embraces puberty rather than making kids feel ashamed of their changing bodies and feelings? All the awards! May we all be as bold as a 13-year-old learning to healthily navigate her emotions.CNN —

The 95th Academy Awards are just about a week away, which means there’s still time to watch some of the nominated films and performances.

Many of the movies on the Oscars ballot are now available on streaming services. The multiverse-hopping opus “Everything Everywhere All at Once” – leading the pack with 11 nominations – can be viewed on Showtime Anytime.

Netflix is the place to watch “All Quiet on the Western Front,” with nine nominations to its name, while HBO Max offers viewers “The Banshees of Inisherin” – also with nine nods – as well as “Elvis,” just behind those with eight. (CNN and HBO Max are both part of the same parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery.)

If Oscar-nominated blockbusters are more your speed, Disney+ has you covered with “Avatar: The Way of the Water,” up for best picture among other categories, and “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,” starring record-setting Oscar nominee Angela Bassett.

This year, all the best picture nominees are available for streaming in fact, either via subscription or for paid on-demand rental. An exhaustive list follows.

Recognizing the inevitably hit-miss nature of sketch comedy, the main question for “History of the World, Part II” is whether the Hulu series yields enough good stuff to justify this extension of the 1981 movie from Mel Brooks, rightfully billed here as an “American treasure.” The show squeaks by, barely, though this is one of those exercises where a little fast-forwarding through “History” couldn’t hurt.

To its credit the series generally matches the irreverence of the original, which was produced in a different comedy era, testing whether it’s possible to still be that proudly offensive. Brooks (now 96, incidentally) introduces the show and the various sketches, which feature an assortment of regulars and guests that includes Nick Kroll, Ike Barinholtz and Wanda Sykes, who, along with Brooks, serve as executive producers.

Musical numbers play a role in the merriment, another Brooks staple, although there’s nothing that quite rivals the giddy absurdity of a song-and-dance routine devoted to the Spanish Inquisition.

Much of the comedy involves updating the gags through the current media moment, from ESPN-style sideline interviews with General Grant during the Civil War to “The Real Concubines of Kublai Khan.”

“History of the World” also revels in inside-showbiz humor, such as William Shakespeare (Josh Gad) running a TV writers’ room, or cheekily filtering the story of Jesus through a movie studio that turns it into what looks like a Rambo movie, down to the trailer’s muscular hero.

Perhaps of necessity, the show fleshes out the episodes by returning to the same sketches multiple times, from a “Fiddler on the Roof”-inspired ode to Russia during the revolution to a ’70s-style sitcom featuring Wanda Sykes as one-time presidential candidate Shirley Chisholm (titled “Shirley,” naturally), complete with an overbearing laugh track.

Not surprisingly, “History of the World” leans into low-brow fare, such as a reenactment of the D-Day invasion that turns into perhaps the longest vomiting scene since “Team America: World Police.”

Brooks might be an “American treasure,” but the first “History of the World” – which followed his most memorable creative and commercial stretch in the 1970s – isn’t exactly fodder for the time capsule, something to keep in mind appraising this version. Hulu will drop the eight half-hours in pairs over successive days, an interesting strategy for a project that doesn’t need to be consumed in any particular order.

On the plus side, the show has no obvious aspirations beyond following the first commandment of comedy – be funny – and if the series does well enough to merit a “Part III,” Brooks and company certainly won’t suffer from a lack of material. After all, they have the whole “World” in their hands.

“History of the World, Part II” premieres March 6 on Hulu.CNN —

As soap operas set against the world of sex, drugs and rock ‘n’ roll go, “Daisy Jones & the Six” is a by-no-means groundbreaking but still-enjoyable account of the best band that never existed, charting its meteoric rise and just-as-abrupt fall. Credit that in part to the cast, starting with Riley Keough, who does her rock lineage and grandpa Elvis proud by belting out the group’s songs.

Each episode (or “track”) uses the title of a vintage song, while employing a faux-documentary-style format as the band members look back, 20 years later, at how they came together in the 1970s, before suddenly breaking up at the top of their game.

The Amazon series is adapted from Taylor Jenkins Reid’s novel, which used Fleetwood Mac as a source of inspiration. But the show mostly works by charting its own course, namechecking cultural artifacts of its era (Barry Manilow and “Rollerball” among them) while more narrowly focusing on the band, with all the festering resentments and simmering attractions that go with the creative process.

At the heart of that lies Keough’s Daisy Jones, a musical force with a mercurial temper who, thanks to the insight of a record executive (Tom Wright), is thrown together with up-and-coming band the Six (there are actually five of them), an ambitious group out of Pittsburgh led by frontman Billy Dunne (Sam Claflin).

Billy winds up marrying his girlfriend (Camila Morrone) for the most rock-star-ish of reasons, but it’s difficult to ignore all that sexual tension with Daisy, which adds a combustible quality to their collaborations – both as songwriters and on stage – in the mesh of their sensibilities, while constantly threatening to the group’s interpersonal dynamics.

Then again, that’s only one of the problematic issues baked into the Six’s interactions, with every source of friction exacerbated by the temptations associated with fame and fortune.

“We didn’t really understand addiction back then,” the group’s lead guitarist, Eddie (Josh Whitehouse), acknowledges during the interviews, while Daisy asks the unseen documentarian – having promised to tell her everything – “How much of ‘everything’ do you really want to know?”

Inevitably, “Daisy Jones” feels derivative of any number of rock ‘n’ roll stories, and the egos and excess that go with them, from “Almost Famous” to the last two versions of “A Star is Born” to Tom Hanks’ ode to one-hit wonders “That Thing You Do.”

Fortunately, the characters in this ensemble are strong enough to carry the show through its season, even if the situations feel less than wholly distinctive.

“It was every band’s dream come true,” the tour manager, played by Timothy Olyphant, muses about the group’s heady brush with rock immortality, as filtered through the in-hindsight prism of its personality-driven collapse.

“Daisy Jones & the Six” doesn’t quite qualify as a dream come true, but it does turn its fictional story into a four-star soap, wistfully capturing this musical era broadly and the sometimes-fleeting nature of stardom. It’s a taste, as Fleetwood Mac put it, of “the stillness of remembering what you had, and what you lost.”

“Daisy Jones & the Six” premieres March 3 on Amazon’s Prime Video.Editor’s Note: The following contains spoilers about the eighth episode of “The Last of Us,” which premiered on March 5.

As “The Walking Dead” and its progeny demonstrated time and again, people – left to their own devices in a lawless society – become the true monsters during a zombie apocalypse, a point made powerfully in the latest episode of “The Last of Us,” while demonstrating how tough, steely and resourceful the teenage Ellie can be.

With Joel (Pedro Pascal) still ailing, Ellie (Bella Ramsey) encountered David (Scott Shepherd), the leader of a starving community that he presides over as its spiritual guide as well as on a more basic level.

“It’s hard to trust strangers, I know,” David said when he first met Ellie, assuring her, “I’m a decent man.”

Yet despite a pleasant voice and sounding completely reasonable at first, David was exposed as a different kind of monster, resorting to cannibalism to feed his struggling flock, and eventually trying to sexually assault the teenage Ellie, who, thanks to her grit, he saw as a kindred spirit.

In one of the more horrific images the series has produced, first Ellie and then Joel witnessed the remnants of what David was relying upon for food, with the latter discovering a gruesome locker where bodies were being stored.

For her part, Ellie fought back after trading a deer for antibiotics in order to help Joel, who recovered enough to torture and kill several of David’s men in order to find her. She also brilliantly leveraged her immunity to the virus as a means of buying herself time when David was about to kill her, before cathartically saving herself with a visceral outburst of violence.

Almost surely by happenstance, the odd-numbered episodes of the series have generally been more memorable than the even ones, a pattern that persisted here. These last several chapters have been notable for the gradual evolution of the Joel-Ellie relationship, underscored when he finally found her at the hour’s end, telling the emotionally drained youth, “It’s OK, baby girl,” with a tenderness that stood in stark relief to the brutality on display otherwise.

Already a huge success for HBO (which, like CNN, is a unit of Warner Bros. Discovery) in terms of viewership and media buzz, the series has one more episode to essentially cement its credentials in terms the other priority associated with prestige-TV fare: Being remembered when Emmy awards season kicks into high gear this spring.

Aside from a rich roster of guest stars, Pascal and Ramsey might not have completely closed that deal given the historic hurdles faced by this genre on that front; still, with each of these last few hours, they continue to build upon what already appeared to be a pretty compelling case.CNN —

HBO’s dark revisionist version of “Perry Mason” didn’t reach its top tier of dramas in the first season but comes considerably closer in the second, achieving a film-noir-ish cool that leans deeply into “L.A. Confidential” territory. Filtering race, sexuality and the corrupting influence of wealth through a 1930s lens, the series feels more relevant and compelling as a glimpse of the present through that past.

After what amounted to a super-attorney origin story when the show premiered way back in 2020, the new episodes pick up months after that storyline, when a businessman connected to a powerful family is murdered. Eager for a conviction, the police arrest a pair of Latinx brothers (Fabrizio Guido, Peter Mendoza), pressing a case that exposes the not-even-veiled racism practiced by the police and district attorney’s office.

Mason (Matthew Rhys, an Emmy nominee for the show) takes the case, which leads down a twisted rabbit hole filled with eccentric captains of industry and shady deals that starkly illustrates the divide between rich and poor, and the different levels of justice that entails.

“I just see it as making things fair,” Mason says at one point of his tilting at windmills, but as the murdered man’s power broker dad (Paul Raci) warns him as the attorney pokes around in his business seeking to exonerate his clients, “Even when you win, Mr. Mason, you lose.”

Once again, the court case plays out against a backdrop that includes the limitations of life 90 years ago, with Mason’s able right hand Della Street (Juliet Rylance) and the D.A., Hamilton Burger (Justin Kirk), both leading closeted existences, with the latter’s secrets making him vulnerable to blackmail.

Mason’s personal life also remains something of a mess as he navigates his divorce, tries to look after his son and in doing so meets a new woman (Katherine Waterston), not that he has a whole lot of time for that.

As noted when the show premiered, the similarities between the familiar TV version of “Perry Mason” (RIP, Raymond Burr) and this gritty take pretty much begin and end with the name, but the emphasis on a trial brings it somewhat closer to the formula. The series is also populated with a topnotch cast, including Chris Chalk as Mason’s investigator Paul Drake, and Shea Whigham and Eric Lange as the kind of hard-bitten characters one might find in an old James Cagney movie.

Understandable skepticism greeted “Perry Mason” when HBO rolled it out, and despite its intriguing pieces, a second season seemed iffy based on the first, surrounded as it is by higher-profile HBO dramas. Credit the producers with upping their game, delivering a show that indeed makes it possible that even if Perry loses, the viewers win.

Chris Rock finally addressed the Oscars slap and made Netflix history on Saturday, with the platform’s first live global streaming event.

“I’m going to try to do a show tonight without offending nobody. I’m going to try my best, because you never know who might get triggered,” Rock said as he opened his set from Baltimore. “People always say words hurt … anybody who says words hurt has never been punched in the face.”

After that quick apparent reference to Will Smith slapping him on stage at last year’s Academy Awards, Rock saved his jokes about the incident until the last ten minutes of the show.

“You all know what happened to me, getting smacked by Suge Smith,” Rock said. “It still hurts. I got ‘Summertime’ ringing in my ears. But I’m not a victim, baby. You’ll never see me on Oprah or Gayle crying … I took that hit like Pacquiao.”

Rock suggested Smith’s response to his Oscars joke about his wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, was more about their relationship than him.

“I love Will Smith, my whole life,” Rock said. “I have rooted for Will Smith my whole life … now I watch ‘Emancipation’ just to see him get whupped.”

Smith plays an enslaved man in the period drama, “Emancipation.”

“‘How come you didn’t do nothing back that night?’” Rock said people have asked him. “Because I got parents. You know what my parents taught me? Don’t fight in front of White people.”

Titled “Chris Rock: Selective Outrage,” the comedian hit on a wide range of topics in the first 50 minutes of the special, including addiction, abortion, racism in America, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, the Kardashian family and “wokeness.”

“I have no problem with the wokeness. I have no problem with it at all. I’m all for social justice. I’m all for marginalized people getting their rights. The thing I have a problem with is the selective outrage,” Rock said. “You know what i’m talking about. One person does something, they get canceled. Somebody else does the exact same thing, nothing. You know what I’m talking about … the kind of people who play Michael Jackson songs but won’t play R. Kelly. Same crime, one of them just has better songs.”

Tackling the country’s division, Rock said, “America is in horrible shape right now.”

“We got it worse than Ukraine. Yeah, I said it. You know why? Because Ukraine is united and America is clearly divided,” Rock joked. “If the Russians came here right now, half the country would say, ‘Let’s hear them out.’ We’re in a bad place right now.”

Rock also delved into his romantic life, saying when he noticed his pillow cases were dirty, he realized how much women do for men.

“I’m trying to date women my age, which is 10 to 15 years younger than me,” he said. “Don’t hate the player, hate the game. I didn’t get rich and stay in shape to talk about Anita Baker. I’m trying to f— Doja Cat.”

The performance was Rock’s sixth standup special and his second for Netflix after 2018’s “Tamborine,” directed by Bo Burnham.

A pre-show event kicked off with comedian Ronny Chieng live from Los Angeles, where he told the crowd, “We could have pretaped this whole thing and nobody would have cared, but we are doing this for a noble cause: To finally try to kill off traditional TV and put it out of its misery. In fact, if you listen hard you can hear Baby Boomers canceling the last cable subscription packages.”

There was also a post-show special with comedians Arsenio Hall, Dana Carvey, David Spade, Yvone Orji and more.CNN —

Ant-Man is a somewhat ironic choice for a very, very big job: Kicking off the next phase of Marvel movies. “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” works on one key level, establishing Kang the Conqueror as a truly formidable and worthy villain. Yet with its plunge into inner space, “Ant-Man” comes up short in almost every other way that matters.

Actually, the rapid descent into the Quantum Realm, a sprawling universe within our own, makes this feel as much like “Guardians of the Galaxy” as Ant-Man, with a vast assortment of strange characters and outlandish, otherworldly and too often murky production design.

With much of the action unfolding on that plane, the movie bears scant resemblance to the original “Ant-Man,” or even its sequel, which overcame its potentially mockable premise with plenty of comedy and a modestly scaled story.

Director Peyton Reed is back for the third time, and the movie begins with a similar sense of whimsy, but similarities to the franchise’s 2015 introduction pretty much end there.

“Quantumania,” by contrast, has a bad case of gigantism, as Paul Rudd’s Ant-Man/Scott Lang is drawn into the Quantum Realm along with the Wasp (Evangeline Lilly), her parents (Michelle Pfeiffer and Michael Douglas) and Scott’s now-grown daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton, a nice addition to a family of heroes that keeps growing through shrinking).

What ensues is an especially psychedelic trip, with precious little grounding in anything that resembles recognizable reality. The most identifiable aspect involves this hidden universe chafing under the rule of a being so powerful that its occupants exhibit a Voldemort-like reluctance to even speak his name, that being Kang the Conqueror, played by Jonathan Majors.

Although he made an appearance in Marvel’s “Loki” TV series, that didn’t prepare audiences for the Thanos-level threat that Kang represents, and Majors invests him with quiet menace and majesty – a sense of gravitas that’s no small feat given the contours of some of the dialogue. If Kang is destined to become the central antagonist as the next batch of movies again build toward an Avengers-sized showdown, Majors is the one thing to emerge from “Quantumania” on which anyone could hang their hat.

One structural problem, in fact, is that Kang’s power and the scope of his evil plans make the hero-villain pairing feel like a decided mismatch – to couch it in terms suited to Majors’ upcoming role in “Creed III,” asking a lightweight to go toe-to-toe with a heavyweight, one that got his start in the comics sparring with the Fantastic Four. It’s a point overtly made by Kang himself, who sneers at Ant-Man, “You’re out of your league.”

A global pandemic, obviously, significantly altered the theatrical playing field for everyone in Hollywood after Marvel’s smashing success with “Avengers: Endgame,” but the studio hasn’t felt like quite as much like a big-league player since that climactic event.

Thanks to its emphasis on Kang, the third “Ant-Man” has taken a necessary step toward something bigger, with the aforementioned “Guardians” and “The Marvels” sequels still to come this year. But it is, at best, a small step, and like much of Marvel’s recent output, only makes “Endgame” loom that much larger in the rearview mirror.

When David “Trugoy the Dove” Jolicoeur of influential rap group De La Soul died last month, fans who wished to hear their work on music streaming services would have been unable to do so due to legal and copyright issues.

But on Friday, De La Soul’s first six albums spanning from 1989 to 2001 finally debuted on Spotify, Apple Music, Tidal and similar music services.

De La Soul’s digital arrival is the culmination of a decades-long battle against copyright constraints and multiple labels, including Tommy Boy Records, the group’s first. The Tommy Boy music catalog was acquired by Reservoir Media in 2021, opening an avenue for the group to appear on streaming.

“The first call we made was to De La Soul,” Reservoir executive Faith Newman said after the acquisition. “We vowed to bring their music to streaming, and it means the world to our team to make good on that promise and expose a whole new generation of listeners to one of the most important catalogs in hip-hop history.”

The pioneering group was formed in 1988 by Jolicoeur, Kelvin “Posdnuos” Mercer and Vincent “Pasemaster Mase” Mason after they attended high school together in Amityville, New York.

Their debut album, 1989’s “3 Feet High and Rising,” is widely credited for its influential, sample-heavy conceptual sound, and included the hit “Me, Myself and I,” which spent 17 weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.

De La Soul’s sampling artistry made digitizing the catalog they built over their career a monumental task, as samples previously cleared for use on vinyl, cassettes and CDs had to be redone for streaming.

The complexity of the group’s work was not the only item holding it back from entering the digital medium. Ownership of their music catalog changed hands several times over the last two decades, and Mercer, Mason and Jolicoeur were outspoken about issues they had with the terms of their Tommy Boy contract.

But the loss of Jolicoeur has made this moment of success bittersweet for the other members. In a heartfelt tribute to Jolicoeur posted on Instagram last week, Mason wrote, “I’m extremely upset at the fact that you’re not here to celebrate and enjoy what we worked and fought so hard to achieve.”

Mason promises he and Mercer “will make sure your legacy is well preserved. ‘We Are De La Soul’ for life and after life, but obviously, it will never be the same.”

Over the course of their performing career, De La Soul was nominated for six Grammy Awards, winning one for best pop collaboration with vocals for the Gorillaz song “Feel Good Inc.” in 2006.

In 2010, the Library of Congress added “3 Feet High and Rising” to the National Recording Registry, the permanent archive of sound recordings considered “culturally, historically or aesthetically significant.” The album is one of only 13 “Rap/Hip-Hop” recordings in the registry.

“The Magic Number,” another song off “3 Feet High and Rising,” was featured as the end-credit song in “Spider-Man: No Way Home” in 2021.

“We’ve been very resilient, even being a group that didn’t have our music up [on streaming platforms]. We still had these beautiful opportunities through young people finding out about us through a commercial or Spider-Man,” Mercer is quoted as saying in Reservoir’s biography of the group.

De La Soul has “naturally been that group for everyone,” Mercer said. “It was never about ‘we’re just here for this community, that community, this set of people or these certain fans of hip-hop culture.’ We see music as music.”CNN —

Megan Piphus Peace has always found magic in puppets.

The self-trained ventriloquist and puppeteer grew up watching the sock puppets on “Lamb Chop’s Play-Along,” the hand puppets of “Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood,” and the muppets of “Sesame Street.” As a child, the characters seemed so alive, and it was only later that she learned what it took to create that sense of reality.

“Puppets allow us to enter the imagination of a child,” Piphus Peace told CNN. “You think of a child playing. Their toys can talk. Their cars can move. So you’re speaking their imaginative and creative language when you’re allowing a puppet to come to life.”

Ever since Piphus Peace discovered that puppetry could be an art form, it’s been a passion – one that she’s pursued throughout her life. These days, she’s the voice of 6-year-old Gabrielle on “Sesame Street,” and the first Black woman puppeteer in the show’s more than 50-year history.

Puppetry became a passion

Piphus Peace learned about puppeteering early on.

When she was 10, a woman at her church wanted to start a puppetry team to perform for the children in the congregation, and assembled a group to attend a puppetry conference. There, Piphus Peace was inspired by the female performers she saw – so much so that when she came home, she told her parents she wanted to be a ventriloquist.

“Onstage, you got to see the interaction between a human and an inanimate object that was coming to life,” Piphus Peace said. “That just had so much magic to me, and I wanted to do the same.”

Her parents were incredibly supportive, she said, and helped her find a puppet and videotapes of ventriloquists for her to learn from. Soon, she was performing for her classmates, and then the entire elementary school.

“I realized how you can captivate the attention of a child with a puppet,” she said. “My soul was just lifted by being able to make kids anywhere from kindergarten to sixth grade smile and laugh.”

During her teenage years, Piphus Peace performed across her hometown of Cincinnati and around the country. Her talents were also on display during her high school valedictorian speech, earning her the nickname “Valedictorian Ventriloquist.” As a college student at Vanderbilt University, she became known as the “Vanderbilt Ventriloquist,” appearing on “The Tonight Show with Jay Leno” in 2012 and on “America’s Got Talent” in 2013.

After getting her undergraduate degree in 2014 and a master’s of science in finance in 2015, Piphus Peace embarked on a career in real estate finance. But all the while, she kept pursuing her interests in ventriloquism and puppetry. She would wake up early to write material, practice in the evenings after work and find opportunities to perform on the weekends.

“I just couldn’t give up the feeling of making audiences smile,” she said.

How she got to Sesame Street

In 2020, Piphus Peace said she was contacted by “Sesame Street” performers Matt Vogel and Martin Robinson, who asked if she’d be willing to learn the signature muppet-style puppetry of the show.

It was definitely an adjustment, Piphus Peace said. She was used to doing stage ventriloquism, which involved interacting with puppets without moving the lips. Muppet-style puppetry meant keeping the body out of the camera frame and using monitors to see how the puppets looked on screen.

She was also working a full-time job and happened to be pregnant with her second child. But she honed her skills in the mornings before work and in the evenings after putting her son to bed. She sent videos to Vogel and Robinson, who in turn would send feedback and notes on her performances. She also joined the “Sesame Street” mentorship program, and practiced puppeteering with fellow mentees.

Later that year, Piphus was asked to play Gabrielle in a CNN and “Sesame Street” town hall on racism. It was a daunting prospect for her first “Sesame Street” appearance – she would be a part of helping children process George Floyd’s killing and the Black Lives Matter protests. But she said having the support of seasoned “Sesame Street” veterans got her through.

“For my first experience with ‘Sesame Street,’ (we were) covering something so necessary in the community and a very necessary discussion,” she said.

In 2021, she joined “Sesame Street” as a full-time cast member. But it was by happenstance that she discovered she was a trailblazer.

Piphus Peace was at the famed Kaufman Astoria Studios in Queens, New York, for her first in-person recording of the show when she came across a wall decorated with photos of the cast and crew. As she looked at the faces of the puppeteers that came before her, she noticed none were Black women.

She asked if there had been other Black female puppeteers on “Sesame Street,” and a producer later informed her that she was the first.

“I realized in that moment that I had made history in a show that had already been around for over 50 years,” Piphus Peace said. “I realized that it would open doors for other Black women, women of color, little boys of color, entering the entertainment space to really see that they can be absolutely anything – no matter how niche or unique.”

Sweeping the clouds away

Through her character Gabrielle, Piphus Peace has been able to model joy, curiosity and self-love for a new generation of “Sesame Street” viewers.

“Gabrielle is a sweet, 6-year-old Black girl muppet,” she said. “She loves everything about her community and her friends. Gabrielle loves to sing and to dance, and she’s had lots of experiences on ‘Sesame Street’ where she’s gotten to sing about colors, about loving her hair.”

While Piphus Peace was a shy child, Gabrielle is the confident girl that she aspired to be, she said. And she hopes that Gabrielle can serve as an inspiration to other kids.

“I hope that kids can learn that we all have beautiful unique differences, but in many ways we’re the same,” she said. “I hope that they learn an unwavering sense of self-confidence.”CNN —

The crime thriller “Mayor of Kingstown” could not be described as light, escapist television.

The Paramount+ series, now in its second season, explores themes of corruption, racism and inequality. It follows the McLusky family as they wield power in the fictional Kingstown, Michigan, where incarceration is the town’s thriving industry.

The drama is co-created by Taylor Sheridan, who also created the “Yellowstone” franchise, and producer Hugh Dillon, whose personal experience growing up in a Canadian town with several penitentiaries has helped shape the show.

“I’m interested in the ethical drift, I’m in interested in the desensitization of both the prisoners and the guards and the world,” Dillon, who also plays a detective on the show, told CNN in a recent interview. “That’s the town I’m from. So it has, it leaves an impact and we just dive into it.”

“Mayor of Kingstown” stars Jeremy Renner as the McLusky patriarch and the town’s “Mayor.” Actor Taylor Handley plays his brother.

“You know, a lot of other shows are nice and poetic, ‘Mayor of Kingstown’ punches you in the face and takes your lunch money,” Handley quipped. “While it is dark and it is violent, there’s so much heart with all the characters and you know, you really end up rooting for all these people.”

Though Renner was critically injured in a highly publicized snowplow accident last month, his colleagues said he is as tough as the character he plays on “Kingstown,” “rocking” his recovery.

“I heard from him 24 hours after the accident and he’s on the road to recovery,” Dillon said. “He’s a fighter and he’s just so funny. In the midst of this tragedy, he just wants to put you at ease.”

Handley recently visited Renner at his home.

“It’s crazy to think how big this story is. I mean, granted, you know, Jeremy is a huge personality, huge superstar,” Handley said.

“He’s just on track. I mean, you know, Hugh kind of hit it. He is a fighter and nothing’s slowing him down. He’s from Modesto, where they raise UFC fighters and lumberjacks. The man is just, you know, has got super human blood in him … there’s no stopping him.”

Earlier this week, Renner teased an upcoming project for Disney and joked that he was “in the shop now, working on me.”

Tobi Bamtefa, who plays Deverin “Bunny” Washington on the series, told CNN he is happy to see Renner’s recovery going so well.

“When I heard about [the accident], I was terrified. I was worried for his well-being … we immediately started praying,” Bamtefa said. “I sent him messages and my whole family has been praying for him. It’s good to see he’s on the mend, and we are praying for a stronger comeback from him.”

Meanwhile, the Season 2 sixth episode of “Mayor of Kingston,” which airs Sunday, has Bamtefa at the center.

“I believe the crux of this show is about humanity,” he said. “In this show and in this world of Kingstown, we are watching people placed in very extreme circumstances, it’s a prison town and people make what comes across as dubious decisions. But, within this world, they actually make perfect sense.”

Bamtefa said he sees the goodness in his character on the show.

“My character is the head of a very notorious gang, but he comes across as someone who is actually quite caring about others and his environment, and he has to balance it with living in this world, having a record and a lot of the labels that society puts on him … someone in his position is normally shown quite hard.”

This season, which was completed months prior to Renner’s accident, is likely not the last for “Mayor of Kingstown.” Dillon said he’s confident they’ll be back for a third, although there’s been no official announcement yet from Paramount.

“We’re moving full steam ahead,” Dillon added. “Taylor Sheridan called me last Sunday. I was putting out the trash and all of a sudden my phone rings as Taylor runs down all of season three and he goes, ‘So this is what’s gonna happen!’ And, you know, once you’re on Taylor time, that’s how that works.”(CNN) As Lisa Marie Presley's three daughters stand to inherit her estate and their grandmother is contesting the validity of her late daughter's will, some close to the family say the legal dispute now in a California court reflects a Presley family history of conflict over money.

Four days after Lisa Marie Presley's Graceland memorial service, Priscilla Presley filed a petition challenging a 2016 amendment in her daughter's will. The change removed Priscilla Presley and former business manager, Barry Siegel, as co-trustees and replaced them with her children, Riley and Benjamin Keough. Benjamin Keough later died in 2020.

Priscilla Presley's petition alleges that she did not receive notice of the amendment while her daughter was alive as was required by her Trust. The petition also notes that Priscilla's name is misspelled in the document, alleges the amendment was not witnessed or notarized and questions the authenticity of Lisa Marie's signature.

Keough has not yet responded to the petition. CNN has contacted her representatives for comment.

Two individuals who were longtime friends of Lisa Marie Presley spoke to CNN about the estate dispute. CNN is not naming the friends as they were not authorized to speak publicly on behalf of the family.

One friend alleged Priscilla Presley's petition is a "money grab."

"This is about Graceland and the memorabilia that Elvis left to Lisa Marie," the source said. "Lisa was the sole heir to his estate. She and her mother were estranged for the last several years. Lisa did not want her mother overseeing the estate. I believe Priscilla is after money and what's inside Graceland."

Priscilla and Lisa Marie Presley's relationship was strained over the years, the friends said, by their respective marriages and divorces, financial mismanagement, and personal trauma that has played out in the public eye as the former wife and the only child of the "King of Rock and Roll," respectively.

CNN made multiple attempts to reach Priscilla Presley's attorney for comment but has not heard back.

In a statement to CNN, sent Friday by a publicist after this story was first published, Priscilla Presley defended her efforts to protect her family's legacy.

"I loved Elvis very much as he loved me. Lisa is a result of our love. For anyone to think anything differently would be a travesty of the family legacy and would be disrespectful of what Elvis left behind in his life," Priscilla Presley said in part. "Please allow us the time we need to work together and sort this out. Please ignore 'the noise.' As I have always been there for Elvis' legacy, our family and the fans, I will continue to forge a pathway forward with respect, honesty, dignity, integrity and love."

Graceland

Priscilla and Elvis Presley divorced in 1973. Lisa Marie Presley was the sole inheritor of Graceland and her father's estate when he died in 1977. Priscilla Presley transformed the property into a lucrative tourist attraction and museum, held in a trust for Lisa Marie Presley until she turned 25.

In 2004, Lisa Marie sold 85% of Elvis Presley Enterprises' assets in a deal reportedly worth more than $100 million . She retained 15% ownership of Elvis Presley Enterprises, which manages operations for Graceland, its related properties and the Graceland Archives. Lisa Marie also maintained complete ownership of the Graceland mansion itself and her late father's personal items housed in its museum, including costumes and cars on display, according to the Graceland website.

A trust with the Graceland property and its contents will now pass on to her daughter, Riley Keough, an accomplished actress and model, along with her twin 14-year-old sisters, a representative for Graceland confirmed to CNN.

Keough has made several films and starred in the first season of the Starz anthology series, "The Girlfriend Experience."

"Riley is a sophisticated, 33-year-old woman who is more than capable of running the estate smoothly," the second close friend of Lisa Marie Presley told CNN.

In 2020, a Presley executive told Rolling Stone that the estate was worth between $400 and $500 million. Lisa Marie Presley annually earned seven figures from her interest in the estate, based on a court filing in her 2022 divorce.

So, now in the petition by Priscilla Presley challenging Lisa Marie's will, she has begun a legal fight against her granddaughter.

"This is about gaining control of what's left of Elvis' estate," one close friend alleged of Priscilla Presley's petition. "It's sad."

Elvis Presley's legacy

Brigitte Kruse, a memorabilia auctioneer, is listed as an attorney-in-fact for Priscilla on her petition.

Benny Roshan, Chair of the Trust and Probate Litigation Group at Greenberg Glusker with estate law expertise, told CNN an attorney-in-fact might be designated in situations where an individual is either "unable, unwilling, [or] unavailable" to act.

"This kind of raises the question of which of those three scenarios necessitates Priscilla filing a lawsuit [with an] attorney-in-fact," Roshan said.

Kruse and her husband started Kruse GWS Auctions Inc. in 2009, according to the company's website . They have collaborated with Priscilla Presley on Elvis memorabilia auctions in the past, though it's unclear what the terms of their financial partnership may be.

"My relationship with Ms. Presley was established years ago," Kruse said in a statement to CNN. "My entire adult career has been devoted to validating and protecting the legacy of Elvis Presley. It has been an honor to be one of the many conservators of the Presley family."

In August, CNN reported that Kruse arranged an auction of "lost" jewelry belonging to Elvis Presley.

"It was ... a collection that we (had) all heard about," Kruse told CNN in an email at the time. "It truly was a myth and a legend until we put our hands on it."

Priscilla Presley helped curate the sale and expressed in an interview with Reuters that she hoped her involvement would help combat the proliferation of fake Elvis memorabilia, adding: "I want to know for sure that that is going to go to someone who is going to care for it, love it."

"Elvis deserved for this collection to be found and displayed in order to preserve his legacy," Kruse said in a press release. "The fans also needed to know about this collection after 50 years, and all of the stories attached to each piece."

Dozens more Elvis Presley memorabilia items were listed as part of an "artifacts of Hollywood and music" auction that began in December 2022.

Kruse told Reuters that the items, such as an address book that belonged to the "It's Now or Never" singer, had increased in value since Lisa Marie Presley's death in an interview published last week

According to a press release, "The telephone address book is well documented by a personal recollection by Priscilla Presley adding to its unique provenance." It sold for $10,000, based on information on the auction site

Elvis Presley's life and career returned to the spotlight in a big way last summer with the Warner Bros. film "Elvis," starring actor Austin Butler in the title role. Priscilla and Lisa Marie Presley collaborated in support of the project. They appeared together at the Golden Globe Awards for the film in January, just days before Lisa Marie's death. (CNN and Warner Bros. are both part of Warner Bros. Discovery).

Away from the spotlight, however, one of Lisa Marie Presley's friends told CNN there was tension between the mother and daughter.

"They put on a united front for the film. It's a family business and they knew that if they began publicly battling it could hurt the bottom line," the friend said. "It was a complicated relationship."CNN —

“Shrinking” starts slowly, feeling like it’s going to be just another dour comedy as much about grief as laughs. Stick with it, though, and this Apple TV+ series from the team behind “Ted Lasso” really grows on you, with some very funny writing, appealing characters, and as a nifty bonus, Harrison Ford as an unexpectedly effective sitcom version of a cranky old man.

Jason Segel stars as Jimmy, a therapist wracked with grief and guilt over the death of his wife, which has turned him into a personal train wreck – outsourcing the upbringing of his teenage daughter (Lukita Maxwell) to his neighbor (Christa Miller) – and risks spilling over into his professional life.

“It’s just awful here without her,” he mutters early on, giving a sense of how emotional wounded he is.

Specifically, Jimmy experiences “compassion fatigue,” and begins telling his patients exactly what he thinks, even if that means prodding them to change their lives in a very un-therapist like way – tiptoeing (and occasionally leaping) over ethical boundaries. He even takes in a young veteran with anger issues (Luke Tennie), violating all those rules about maintaining professional distance.

All of this is unsettling to Jimmy’s two colleagues, Gaby (Jessica Williams) and Paul (Ford, wearing a lot hats right now, with two streaming series, including “1923”), the former dealing with a failing marriage, the latter in the early stages of Parkinson’s disease.

Everyone here, in other words, has issues, and Jimmy’s – which is crippling at first – isn’t particularly original, inasmuch as Ricky Gervais explored very similar themes as a widowed guy in the melancholy “After Life.”

What makes “Shrinking” tolerable at first, and quite good as it progresses, is that everyone here is also funny, milking laughs out of amusing situations and sharp dialogue, from an uncomfortable encounter at a soccer game to a planned wedding proposal that doesn’t exactly go as planned.

Created by Segel and the “Lasso” tandem of Bill Lawrence (who is married to Miller) and Brett Goldstein, “Shrinking” also keeps putting together different characters in sweetly unexpected ways, from Paul quietly counseling Jimmy’s daughter to Gaby and Liz starting at odds and gradually finding common ground.

The show thus keeps revealing layers and dimensions to the characters, who seem to be having a ball playing off each other. That’s perhaps especially true of Ford, who real vulnerability beneath the gruff exterior, acting as a de facto father to Jimmy while grappling with greater fragility thanks to his condition.

In a way, the series has a good deal in common with “Ted Lasso,” in the sense that it succeeds not because of its premise – which sounds completely ordinary and familiar – but in spite of it. “Shrinking” isn’t a big idea, but with a big heart and genuine laughs, it, too, achieves its goal.

“Shrinking” premieres January 27 on Apple TV+. (Disclosure: Lowry’s wife works for a unit of Apple.)CNN —

For some people, relaxation looks like settling down with a nice glass of wine and the most graphic, disturbing tale of murder imaginable.

True crime stories have always appealed to our baser natures. Now, the genre is practically a lifestyle, with endless docuseries, podcasts and investigations to binge and discuss over TikTok comments or the brunch table. An entire genre of lifestyle-slash-true-crime videos commands hundreds of thousands of followers on YouTube, where influencers do their makeup while casually discussing all manner of atrocities.

It’s absurd, in a way, how something so dark has found such a hallowed place in the pantheon of pop culture. “Saturday Night Live” produced its own classic take on “murder shows,” and TikTok is full of jokes about people appearing to peacefully go about their lives while the voice in their headphones drones on about cut-off arms and legs. True crime releases show no signs of slowing down, with recent streaming titles including “The Hatchet Wielding Hitchhiker” (Netflix) and “Death in the Dorms” (Hulu).

However, the boom in sordid tales of human woe has led some true crime enthusiasts to consider the ethical ramifications of their passion. After all, true crime is called “true” for a reason. At the heart of every new Netflix special or headline-making investigation is a victim and a family, to say nothing of the countless people whose involvement in these tragedies amounts to far more than entertainment. Is there an ethical way to be a true crime fan? And if there is, what’s acceptable and what’s not?

One fan draws the line

Bobbi Miller, an entertainment expert and host of the entertainment podcast “The Afternoon Special,” has been leading conversations about ethical true crime consumption for years. She says she felt uncomfortable watching “Dahmer,” the first installment of a Netflix true crime anthology series that focused on the notorious serial killer.

She felt even more uncomfortable watching the series explode in popularity despite widespread concerns among true crime watchers that the slickly produced series glamorized Jeffrey Dahmer and unfolded counter to the wishes of some of his victims’ families. Evan Peters, who played the titular role, even won a Golden Globe for his portrayal, inviting further outcry from people affected by Dahmer’s very real crimes.

“I do think true crime is unethical,” she tells CNN. “It doesn’t mean it’s something that shouldn’t exist. The line in the sand, for me, is whether a piece of media takes a fiction or non-fiction approach, in terms of sensationalizing the narrative or trying create appeal around a criminal.”

While some documentaries and other media contain nuance and respect that sets them apart from more sordid offerings, Miller says she still encourages people to not let their enjoyment of true crime cross the line into obsession. Ethical true crime stories, she says, are the ones that focus on victims and don’t center the criminal as some cult of personality or mysterious mind to untangle.

“When you walk away from a true crime story, it should be with a certain amount of reverence for the victim,” she says.

Entertainment or reality?

The viewing public has always had a strong interest in so-called “trials of the century,” whether they crowded around a TV during the OJ Simpson trial in the 1990s or snatched up newspapers to keep track of the crimes of Lizzie Borden in the 1800s. However, the popularity of 2014’s “Serial” podcast launched true crime into a new era of ubiquity. Over the next decade, it became one of the most popular genres across multiple forms of media. In 2020, true crime was the third most popular podcast genre across all major podcast platforms, with major shows like “My Favorite Murder” and “Crime Junkie” clocking in among the top 10 most listened-to offerings for the year.

Women are more likely to be true crime fans than men, and that was true even before the current “Serial”-led era. Now, women are much more likely to follow true crime stories on social media – a major meeting place for people to either consume so-called murder shows together or comment on current cases.

This gendered appeal is evident in all the ways true crime bleeds into other areas of pop culture: Many popular true crime influencers on YouTube are young women. Before fans dig in to their latest documentary, an endless supply of murder-themed merch on Etsy assures they can snuggle up with a “This is my true crime watching blanket” throw, light a Jeffrey Dahmer-themed candle or pour some tea in a mug that reads, “Roses are red, violets are blue. I’ve watched enough crime shows. They’ll never find you.”

Miller also notes that true crime fans communicate and trade information in ways that are very similar to other entertainment fandoms.

“The difference is, ‘Star Wars’ and Marvel fandoms treat their fiction as if it’s real, where true crime fandoms treat something very real as fiction,” she says.

Why, exactly, true crime is so appealing is its own unsolved mystery.

“I definitely think that part of the reason women are drawn to true crime is that there is a level of relatability for women to the victims in these stories,” says Brigham Young University communications professor Kevin John. “And we often project ourselves onto the media we consume.”

This blurred line can cause real damage when true crime fans look past sordid docuseries and addicting podcasts to find entertainment in real-life cases that have yet to fully bear out. The murder of four University of Idaho students in late 2022 is a tragic example of what happens when crimes are treated as mysteries to be solved. The investigation went on for weeks before police arrested suspect Bryan Kohberger, prompting amateur detectives to post various theories, including unfounded accusations against those they suspected, online.

True crime content has gotten a huge boost from TikTok and YouTube, where cases new and old can be broken down into a few short, tantalizing segments or spun together for hour-plus deep dives that lock in fascinated viewers. These platforms are also where a lot of true crime influencers and devotees are trying to work through the ethical quandaries of the genre.

Several meaningful conversations have been started by family members or loved ones of victims who have seen their pain turned into entertainment – sometimes against their will.

Mariah Day’s mother, Betsy Faria, was murdered in 2011, and her case attracted breathless media coverage, including a spot on Dateline. In 2022, her story was part of a drama miniseries called “The Thing About Pam,” starring Renee Zellwegger as the titular Pam Hupp, who was charged with Faria’s murder in 2021.

Day uses her TikTok account to advocate for victim awareness, and give people a glimpse of what it’s like on the other side of the true crime love affair.

“My trauma is not your entertainment,” she says in one video. “Awareness is a whole different story. Let’s talk about it.”

True crime fans who are trying to be responsible about their interests sometimes call for others to avoid certain media, either because of the narrative or because it was created without the consent of those affected.

Even Dr. Phil – the Dr. Phil, who comments on criminal cases as part of his brand – has shared tips on how to responsibly consume true crime content.

While he says curiosity for the dark side of human nature is normal, “don’t fall for some romanticized version. Focus on the facts. There’s no soundtrack in life. Only pain.” He also suggests doing something positive for the families of victims, learning about crime legislation, or using true crime as a teaching moment to help others stay alert.

This deconstruction, this interrogation of what true crime entertainment provides and who it endangers, doesn’t necessarily run counter to enjoyment of the genre, as many debates about true crime ethics begin within the community itself.

Miller points out that there are larger social issues at play. “It’s really fascinating to observe who interacts with true crime. It’s a lot of White women,” she says. “That says a lot when you think about the types of cases that get this kind of coverage, and the types of cases that get attention in the US judicial system.”

The public tendency to focus on young, White female victims is an enduring complication of true crime, stretching back through the cases of JonBenét Ramsey, Madeleine McCann and Natalee Holloway to more recently, the murder of Gabby Petito. This “missing White woman syndrome,” as it’s colloquially called, is another facet that proponents of ethical true crime seek to confront.

Jordan Preston’s sister, Brooke Preston, was stabbed to death by her roommate in 2017. Preston attracted a social media following after heavily criticizing the 2021 documentary “Dead Asleep,” which profiles her sister’s killer and his defense that he committed the murder while sleepwalking.

When one TikTok commenter asked her how there would be any documentaries at all if families always had a say, Preston replied that kind of attention could actually go toward pursuing justice for others.

“Can someone please explain why your entertainment is so much more important than … what a victim’s family wants?” she said in response. “There are so many crimes committed (where) victims don’t get the type of recognition and attention and media coverage they literally need to get solved. For some reason, (other) victims’ families are getting re-victimized, and put through trauma they need to deal with all over again.”

Ethical true crime, then, could be the kind that puts victims and their loved ones first, or explores how and which cases get solved and how the legal system bears out. It could be the kind, as victim advocates suggest, that focuses on cases of missing and exploited Indigenous people and people of color. Mindful true crime fans want to be kept up at night by the answers they seek – not by the harm the genre may cause others.CNN —

Angela Bassett had to grapple with loss and grief during her reign as Queen Ramonda in Marvel’s “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.”

“This movie was about grief and loss, family, a remembrance, a legacy and moving on,” Bassett told Deadline in an interview published this week. “That’s something that’s so very human.”

Her loss was that of the 2018 “Black Panther” film’s star Chadwick Boseman, who played King T’Challa. Boseman died in August 2020 after a battle with colon cancer at age 43.

Yet, the two-time Oscar nominee managed to find light amid the darkness once “Wakanda Forever” came out.

“To actually connect with audience members who have gone through some of this, and it being a source of comfort and conversation for them and their families, that really is quite an honor that you’re not expecting,” Bassett said.

She added that it’s an “honor” when entertainment has a real impact on the lives of viewers.

“Wakanda Forever” honored Boseman’s King T’Challa with a farewell that felt fitting for not just the character, but for the beloved actor, too.

“It’s just ever hopeful,” Bassett said of the film. “I think we definitely tried to impart the feeling of, ‘A good morning comes after a long, dark night.’”

Bassett made history when she was nominated for best supporting actress for her role in “Wakanda Forever,” becoming the first actor to earn an Oscar nod for a Marvel film.

While that historic marker will live on in real life, Bassett’s Queen Ramonda saw her final end in the movie – something the actor admitted that she was “shocked” and “surprised” to learn at first. Bassett said she even pushed back against it to the film’s director Ryan Coogler.

“I love being queen,” Bassett said, adding that she’s “ultimately there to serve the vision of the filmmaker” and that she “got over it” quickly.

It should be noted, though, that in the fantastical Marvel universe a character’s on-screen death doesn’t always mean an absolute end.

Bassett hinted toward that theory applying to Queen Ramonda, saying, “I think anything is possible.”

In addition to Bassett’s historic Oscar nomination, she also made history in January at the Golden Globes, becoming the first performer to win a Globe in an acting category for their role in a Marvel film.CNN —

The “Rocky” sequels aren’t exactly known for their nuanced opponents, so give “Creed III” credit for trying to flesh out its antagonist, played by Jonathan Majors. But bulking up the back story slows the pacing, in a movie that finally delivers the goods but whose broader ambitions under director/star Michael B. Jordan get boxed in by its ring-shaped formula.

If only the script and story were in the same kind of fighting shape as its leads. Grounding the narrative in Adonis Creed’s past does provide a weightier foundation, but the tradeoff is an element of sluggishness in a movie that, despite its impressive cast, never feels particularly light on its toes.

A 20-year-old flashback introduces the young Adonis at a pivotal moment with his friend Damian (Majors when he grows up), a promising Golden Gloves boxer. Something happens that sends the latter to jail, and after his release 18 years later he’s eager to make up for lost time, even though he’s past what would normally be considered any fighter’s prime.

Adonis, meanwhile, is happily retired from the ring, helping develop boxers (including the reigning heavyweight champ) and orchestrate fights, while happily raising his young daughter (Mila Davis-Kent) with his wife Bianca (Tessa Thompson). Still, he carries guilt over what transpired with Damian, resisting Bianca’s pleas to open up about their history and what’s gnawing at him.

Hoping to make amends, Adonis throws Damian work as a sparring partner for the champ, though his old friend still hungers for the title shot he was denied. When circumstances derail a planned championship bout an opportunity presents itself, with the prospect of giving an unknown his chance drawing comparisons to the late Apollo Creed’s long-ago stunt with that Rocky guy.

Adonis presses ahead, ignoring the objections of his former trainer and now partner, played by Wood Harris. (Sylvester Stallone, for the first time, has opted to sit this one out, although he is credited among the producers.)

“I still got gas in the tank,” Damian insists in response to Adonis’ initial skepticism, and Majors – the highlight of the recent “Ant-Man” sequel – invests the character with a quiet sense of menace and determination that does feel combustible.

While that construction makes a good deal of sense (“Creed” director Ryan Coogler shares story credit with his brother, Keenan Coogler, and Zach Baylin), there’s a flatness to the middle rounds – including the time devoted to Adonis’ domestic bliss – before getting down to business.

The same goes for the boxing sequences, which stumble a bit when Jordan seeks to expand the template by incorporating slow motion and a moment when the world essentially melts away, leaving only the fighters to duke it out in an empty void – an interesting device that ultimately doesn’t quite work.

Those deductions aside, the Jordan-Majors dynamic (as it happens, a faceoff of two topnotch Marvel villains) imbues the movie with heavyweight talent in more ways than one. The challenge is that the durability of the “Rocky” franchise from which “Creed” has cleverly drawn in the earlier films makes it as difficult to mess up its simplest charms as it is to enhance or deviate from them.

“Creed III” offers enough appealing elements, old and new, to finally come out ahead on points. Yet those strengths are balanced by shortcomings that make that judgment something seldom seen in this winner-take-all movie world of boxing – namely, a split decision.

Harrison Ford has said he intends to hang up his whip as Indiana Jones after the new film hits theaters, but famed film composer John Williams isn’t so sure “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” will be his own last film adventure.

In an interview with CNN’s Chris Wallace for a new episode of “Who’s Talking to Chris Wallace?” the 91-year-old Oscar winner, a frequent collaborator of director Steven Spielberg, said while it is possible that the forthcoming fifth installment of the Indiana Jones franchise could be the final film on which he acts as composer, he’s leaving the door open.

“I’m not anxious to go into another film. But…Steven is a hard man to say no to,” he said. “If he should turn around tomorrow with another ‘Schindler’s List,’ you probably have to fight me to keep me away from it.”

Williams and Spielberg first worked together on the 1974 film, “The Sugarland Express.”

Williams went on to compose a litany of iconic scores for the director, including the ones for “Jaws,” “E.T. The Extra Terrestrial” and “Jurassic Park.” He also composed the score for Spielberg’s Oscar-nominated “The Fabelmans,” which was inspired by the director’s life.

Williams said above all, he’s “grateful to be working in music.” He recently finished composing a violin concerto for German violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter and, he said, “not doing a film has made that possible.”

“There’s one thing I would say about working in film, a film like Indiana Jones can take six months,” he said. “Six months when you’re 91 is a long time. So, you’re asking somebody to make a commitment from what a large percentage of the time, the earthly time you may have left.”

Luckily, Williams said, he’s feeling “healthy” and, in fact, called this time in his life a special one.

“I like to think that…from 80 to 90 is the best decade of a woman’s or a man’s life. For the reason that from 80 to 90, you lose a little something. You don’t walk quite as fast, you don’t hit a golf ball quite as far. But there are enormous compensations,” he said. “You see the great beauty around us. The music, it means so much more to me every passing day.”

The trailer for Disney’s “Peter Pan & Wendy” – based on the Mouse House’s 1953 animated classic “Peter Pan” – dropped on Tuesday, and it certainly presents a movie that looks far more inclusive than past retellings of the original J.M. Barrie tale.

“But you’re not all boys,” Ever Anderson’s Wendy Darling says to a group of kids in Neverland who tell her they’re the “Lost Boys” in the clip.

Those kids are, in fact, not all boys. Two girls then appear on screen to respond to Wendy’s observation with a simple and spirited, “So!?”

“Blackish” star Yara Shahidi is also seen in the trailer as Tinker Bell, Peter’s fairy friend who accompanies him and the Darlings through Neverland. Shahidi is the first Black woman to portray the tiny fairy on screen.

The movie also stars Alexander Molony in his feature film debut as Peter Pan, and Jude Law as a very creepy-looking Captain Hook, who is seen in the trailer sporting his signature hook, red coat and twisted mustache as he asks Wendy, “Where is Peter Pan?”

The trailer shows all of the classic figures from the ’53 film, including the Darlings’ beloved dog Nana and a faithful representation of John Darling (Joshua Pickering) in his top hat and rounded spectacles.

An aerial view of the mermaids shimmering and splashing in the sea beneath Wendy and her brothers, who are soaring the skies above, is shown in the trailer. And Tiger Lily, played by Alyssa Wapanatâhk, is seen telling Wendy, “Hold the past in your heart, but where you go from here is up to you.”

From the 1991 cult classic “Hook” starring Robin Williams, Dustin Hoffman and Julia Roberts to NBC’s 2014 “Peter Pan Live” telecast starring Allison Williams and the 2015 “Pan” film, Peter Pan and Wendy’s adventure is a story that’s been previously visualized on screen in countless ways.

The new “Peter Pan & Wendy” presents an inclusive version of the classic tale, one that blends Pan’s fantasy world into a landscape for today.

Please don’t stop the music for Rihanna – she’s not done yet.

Fresh off of her record-breaking 2023 Super Bowl Halftime performance, Rihanna is set to perform “Lift Me Up” from Marvel’s “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever” during the Oscars telecast on March 12, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced on Thursday.

“Lift Me Up” was co-written by Rihanna, Tems, Ludwig Göransson and the film’s director Ryan Coogler. The ballad is nominated for best original song at this year’s Oscars, marking Rihanna’s first-ever Academy Award nomination.

“Hold My Hand” by Lady Gaga and BloodPop, written for “Top Gun: Maverick,” is also nominated in the best original song category. Other films with songs nominated are “Tell It like a Woman,” “RRR” and “Everything Everywhere All at Once.”

Halle Bailey can’t wait for audiences to see the new live-action “The Little Mermaid” and is unfazed by naysayers.

In a new interview with The Face published on Thursday, the singer and actor said that the backlash that arose when news broke of her being cast as mermaid Ariel – and again when the first glimpse of her in the role was revealed last fall – was not surprising.

“As a Black person, you just expect it and it’s not really a shock anymore,” the Grammy nominee said.

“People don’t understand that when you’re Black there’s this whole other community,” she shared. “It’s so important for us to see ourselves.”

To that point, Bailey also mentioned that after the teaser dropped, when parents started sharing videos of their Black daughters marveling at Bailey as Ariel, she stared at them “in disbelief.”

​”It makes me feel more grateful for where I am,” she said.

The rising star also credited the “Little Mermaid” filmmakers with allowing her authentic identity to be a part of this new iteration of the aquatic Disney princess, specifically with regard to her hair.

​”As a Black woman, hair is spiritual, especially locs,” Bailey said, also mentioning that a significant portion of prep time on set was devoted to analyzing how her hair moved in water.

“It was really cool for them to make Ariel a version of me with my locs,” she added.

“The Little Mermaid,” based on the 1989 animated classic, also stars Melissa McCarthy as sea witch Ursula. It is slated for release on May 26.CNN —

It is one of the most beloved movie series of all time, but Peter Jackson’s “The Lord of the Rings” trilogy only scratched the surface of the rich world of Middle-earth created by J.R.R. Tolkien.

And “multiple” new movies set in Middle-earth are in the works, Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav announced on Thursday in an earnings call, after studio heads Mike De Luca and Pam Abdy signed a deal with Freemode, a division of Swedish entertainment company Embracer Group, which acquired the movie rights to Tolkien’s work in August last year. (Warner Bros. Discovery is the parent company of CNN.)

Warner Bros. will produce the movies together with sister company New Line Cinema and Freemode, “expanding upon the much-loved world and characters of Middle-earth,” a statement released by Embracer read.

Currently, New Line and Warner Bros. Animation are in production on an anime movie “The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim,” a story set 183 years before the events of “The Lord of the Rings,” recounting the fate of Helm Hammerhand, a King of Rohan.

Neither the cost of the deal nor the creative team were revealed, although Jackson and his collaborators Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens told CNN in a statement that Warner Bros. and Embracer have kept them “in the loop” and that they “look forward to speaking with them further to hear their vision for the franchise moving forward.”

Jackson’s original trilogy, released between 2001 and 2003, was widely acclaimed, collecting 17 Academy Awards and generating almost $3 billion at the box office.

Other adaptations of Tolkien’s books have since been produced for the big and small screens.

Jackson’s “The Hobbit” movie trilogy also generated almost $3 billion in global receipts, while Amazon, which owns the TV rights to “The Lord of the Rings,” released its first season of “The Rings of Power” in 2022.

“Twenty years ago, New Line took an unprecedented leap of faith to realize the incredible stories, characters and world of ‘The Lord of the Rings’ on the big screen,” De Luca and Abdy said in a statement.

“But for all the scope and detail lovingly packed into the two trilogies, the vast, complex and dazzling universe dreamed up by J.R.R. Tolkien remains largely unexplored on film. The opportunity to invite fans deeper into the cinematic world of Middle-earth is an honor,” they added.(CNN) After winning a Grammy Award, Viola Davis has officially completed the holy grail of entertainment awards.

Davis' Sunday win for the audiobook of her memoir "Finding Me" completes her EGOT collection. She previously won an Emmy for her role in "How to Get Away with Murder," an Oscar for "Fences," and two Tony awards for "King Hedley III" and "Fences."

In her acceptance speech, the multi-hyphenate performer paid tribute to her younger self.

"I wrote this book to honor the 6-year-old Viola," she said. "To honor her life, her joy, her trauma, everything. And, it has just been such a journey -- I just EGOT!"

The Oscars have always served as a celebration of movies, carving out time not devoted to the “And the Oscar goes to” part to cheerleading for Hollywood. Yet with movies in a state of flux amid the shift to streaming and a global pandemic that hobbled theaters, Academy voters appear to be trying to strike a balance between streaming and blockbusters, and whether they can be, if not everything everywhere all at once, all things to all people.

If the awards in the run-up to the Academy Awards hold true, “Everything Everywhere All at Once” will walk away with the most coveted hardware. Having amassed honors from the guilds representing directors, producers, writers, actors, and editors, its frontrunner status has been cemented in place.

Should that prediction hold, Oscar voters will anoint a movie that actually thrived box-office-wise – earning more than $100 million worldwide, a record for its independent distributor, A24 – while still feeling small-boned compared to the titans that have led a movie-going comeback.

At one of those aforementioned award events, director Steven Spielberg thanked Tom Cruise for having “saved” Hollywood with “Top Gun: Maverick,” the long-delayed sequel that earned nearly $1.5 billion worldwide at the box office. The same could be said for James Cameron’s “Avatar: The Way of Water,” which like its predecessor soared above the $2-billion global plateau to become the third-highest-grossing title of all time.

Despite its relative commercial success, “Everything Everywhere” – a mind-bending trip through a multiverse of possibilities – tilts toward a more intimate brand of filmmaking, joining movies like “Nomadland” and “Moonlight” in notching wins at the Independent Spirit Award on its march to the Oscars.

While major studio releases can earn an invitation to the Oscar party, despite the gratitude that Spielberg articulated, that probably won’t translate to the guest-of-honor seat. And the skepticism about honoring big movies reflects a lingering schism, if not quite disdain, in regard to the kind of fare that in recent years has dominated the box office, particularly when it comes to superheroes and science fiction – films perceived to put a premium on spectacle and experience at the expense of plot and story.

The Academy has publicly grappled with this dynamic, even flirting a few years ago with introducing a “popular film” category before nixing the idea. Such allowances weren’t deemed necessary back when mass appeal and awards frequently went hand in hand, including best-picture wins for Cameron’s “Titanic,” “Gladiator” and “The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King.”

To an extent, just nominating popular films might help spur interest in the ceremony and improve ratings, a major incentive. With its worldwide gross of $2.3 billion, “Avatar’s” tally is more than four times that of the other eight best-picture contenders (excluding “Top Gun”) combined.

At the same time, Hollywood has embraced streaming as a viable awards option, without fully tackling the fact that movies designed to thrive on those platforms are playing a somewhat different game.

The pandemic helped erode that resistance, as witnessed by best-picture honors for Apple TV+’s “CODA” and Hulu’s “Nomadland,” both produced for roughly the same amount “Avatar” likely spent on its catering budget.

Even with a diminished presence at this year’s Oscars, streaming services probably won’t leave empty handed. A pair of Netflix offerings, best-picture nominee “All Quiet on the Western Front” and “Guillermo del Toro’s Pinocchio,” are leading contenders for best international feature and animated movie, respectively.

In an analysis for Variety, awards expert Tim Gray saw a glass-half-full scenario in this year’s Oscar nominees, citing the wide cross-section of films, “from big epics to intimate dramas,” and noting that while many address dark topics, “they generally conclude on a note of hope. That’s true of the characters — and of moviegoing in the 21st century.”

With a robust lineup of theatrical releases slated for spring and summer, the rebuilding process that “Avatar,” “Top Gun” and “Spider-Man: No Way Home” began continues.

Yet it’s equally possible to look at the eclectic lineup of Oscars nominees, including numerous movies that flopped when released in theaters, and conclude that the entertainment industry remains pulled in multiple directions, without a clear blueprint to what the future holds.

In that sense, the Oscars might end up proving that you can have “Everything Everywhere All at Once,” but not have your cake and eat it too.

The women and girls of Showtime’s hit series “Yellowjackets” are back, and they’re continuing to flirt with the darkness in the Season 2 trailer, released on Thursday.

The creepy clip begins with the scarred Van, played as a teen by Liv Hewson, telling a fireside tale about the “wilderness” – also known as the unforgiving forest the soccer team finds themselves still stranded in after the horrifying plane crash from last season – calling it beautiful, violent and “misunderstood.”

“And it waited and waited to befriend whoever arrived,” Van continues cryptically.

Not only does the trailer give viewers a glimpse at the adult Van, played by “Six Feet Under” star Lauren Ambrose, but it also confirms that Lottie (Courtney Eaton), until now only seen as her kooky teen self, survived the Yellowjackets’ ordeal. The character is played as an adult by Simone Kessell.

In one heated moment among the surviving adult counterparts, someone says, “Lottie can help us.”

Christina Ricci’s Misty asks feverishly, “The Lottie who was committed to a mental institution in Switzerland, Lottie?!”

“Yes,” adult Natalie (Juliette Lewis) replies.

Set to a beguiling new cover of No Doubt’s signature hit “Just a Girl” by none other than Florence + The Machine, the “Yellowjackets” trailer also reveals Taissa’s (Tawny Cypress) significant and continued mental issues, as well as adult Shauna (Melanie Lynskey) low-key owning up to her murderous ways to her daughter.

Toward the end, after the teen clan hauntingly chants, “We hear the wilderness, and it hears us,” a brief snippet shows the younger Misty (Samantha Hanratty) and Van shouldering a log… with a person tied to it.

“I think sh**’s gonna get a lot worse out here,” someone says in voice-over, a statement that shocks essentially no one who’s been watching the show.

Season 2 of “Yellowjackets” also features new cast addition Elijah Wood. It premieres on Showtime on March 24.CNN —

Robert Blake, noted actor and Emmy-winner who starred in crime series “Baretta,” has died, according to his daughter, Delinah Blake Hurwitz. He was 89.

Delinah Blake Hurwitz told CNN in an email that her father died “peacefully” on Thursday “surrounded by family.”

Robert Blake died in Los Angeles from heart disease, according to his niece Noreen Austin, who released an obituary notice via a representative.

Over the course of more than 60 years working as a professional actor, Robert Blake amassed a number of memorable credits, including 1967’s “In Cold Blood” and David Lynch’s 1997 film “Lost Highway,” the actor’s final screen credit.

In 2001, Robert Blake’s second wife Bonny Lee Bakley was found murdered in the San Fernando Valley. In 2005, the actor was acquitted of murder charges relating to the case. He later lost a civil suit brought forth by Bakley’s children.

A vast career

Robert Blake, born in Nutley, New Jersey on September 18, 1933, went by his birth name of Michael Gubitosi until 1942. He got his start in Hollywood as a child actor in the “Our Gang” movie shorts in 1939 as Mickey, one of the Little Rascals, continuing under the name of “Bobby Blake” in various “Our Gang” shorts until the early ’40s.

He starred in his first film in 1942 as Daniel ‘Mokey’ Delano in “Mokey,” about a troubled young boy navigating life at home with his father and stepmother. In 1948, he appeared in “Treasure of the Sierra Madre,” which costarred the legendary Humphrey Bogart.

In 1967, Robert Blake starred as Perry in the film “In Cold Blood,” based on Truman Capote’s 1965 novel of the same name, about the murder of a family in Holcomb, Kansas.

Robert Blake later went on to star in the 1970s television crime series “Baretta.” He won an Emmy Award for his role on the show, in which he played the title character, a New York City undercover detective. The series aired for four seasons on ABC from 1975-1978.

His other notable credits include the 1960s series “Rawhide,” the 1981 TV movie “Of Mice and Men” and 1995’s “Money Train” with Woody Harrelson and Jennifer Lopez.

Criminal trial

On May 4, 2001, Robert Blake’s wife, Bonny Lee Bakley, was found shot in the head in his car after eating at Vitello’s, a neighborhood restaurant in Studio City. Robert Blake said at the time that the murder occurred while he had briefly returned to the restaurant.

Robert Blake was arrested in April 2002 on charges of first degree murder with special circumstances and two counts of solicitation of murder. He pleaded not guilty at his arraignment.

That same year, the administrators of Bakley’s estate filed a civil wrongful death suit against Robert Blake, seeking unspecified damages on behalf of Bakley’s four children.

In March of 2005, Robert Blake was acquitted of the murder of Bakley in the criminal proceedings, but was found liable in the wrongful death civil suit brought by Bakley’s children. The actor was ordered to pay $30 million in damages to her family. The amount of damages awarded to Bakley’s children was later reduced to $15 million after Robert Blake’s lawyers appealed the civil suit, but the Los Angeles court upheld the wrongful death verdict.

In 2011, Robert Blake published a memoir titled “Tales of a Rascal: What I Did for Love.” He appeared on CNN in an interview with Piers Morgan in 2012 to promote the book and accused Morgan of calling him a “liar” when questioned about Bakley’s murder.

He maintained his innocence in connection to the murder of his wife.

Gerry Schwartzbach, who represented Robert Blake during the trial, told CNN in a statement that the actor “was a complicated man.”

“He and I spent parts of virtually every day together over the year I lived in LA working on his case. We had a strong bond,” the attorney said. “I am saddened by his passing, but glad that he is no longer suffering.”

According to his family’s statement, in recent years, Robert Blake lived quietly in the Los Angeles area. In lieu of flowers, his family requests that donations be made to City of Hope.

“Stranger Things” star Grace Van Dien says she’s been declining acting roles after experiencing sexual harassment on set.

The 26-year-old actress, best known for playing cheerleader Chrissy Cunningham in the Netflix sci-fi drama, addressed her decision to be more selective this week during a Twitch live stream, saying ” the last few projects I’ve worked on I didn’t have the best experiences with some of the people I had to work for.”

Van Dien went on to recount a particular incident, in which an unnamed film producer allegedly propositioned her on set.

“One of the last movies I did, one of the producers asked me to… like, he hired a girl that he was sleeping with and then he had her ask me to have a threesome with them,” Van Dien said. “So… like, that’s my boss. And then I didn’t and I cried and I was so upset.”

Van Dien shared that she’s focusing on streaming for now because she gets to “choose who I hang out with, who I talk to.”

On Thursday, Van Dien tweeted that her professional priorities are changing.

“As I get older, my work priorities are changing,” she told her 231,000 Twitter followers. “I’m waiting for the right project/the right people to work with. 🎥🤍”

She added: “it’s nice to feel calm.”

CNN has contacted Van Dien’s representatives for further comment.

Before her breakout role in “Stranger Things”, Van Dien, who is the daughter of “Starship Troopers” actor Casper Van Dien, appeared on TV shows such as “The Village” and “Greenhouse Academy.” Her film credits include “V for Vengeance” and “What Comes Around.”

Van Dien, who regularly streams herself playing games like “Fortnite” and “Overwatch” on Twitch under the handle @BlueFille, has 293,000 followers on the platform.CNN —

If the last “Scream” movie made noise by wedding the old with the new, “Scream VI” reinforces how shrewd the producers were in casting the next generation, with Melissa Barrera and Jenna Ortega ably carrying this chapter of horror’s most self-referential franchise. Throw in a new venue and the same old thrills and kills, and Paramount should be slashing all the way to the bank.

The ad campaign makes a little too much, in a “Start spreading the news” kind of way, of shifting the action to New York City. While that does provide some fresh wrinkles (on the subway, no one can hear you you-know-what), slicing and dicing up the Big Apple doesn’t do anything significant to shake up the basic formula.

Fortunately, the city that never sleeps is now home to Tara (Ortega, red hot from her “Wednesday” role), who’s attending college there, and her sister Sam (“In the Heights’” Barrera), who is keeping a watchful eye over her sibling, including her willingness to tase anyone who might invade her space.

The central quartet also includes holdovers and fellow Woodsboro survivors Chad (Mason Gooding) and Mindy (Jasmin Savoy Brown), the latter being the keeper of the “We’re going to recite the rules” monologue. A year has passed since their last adventure with a killer Ghostface, which has left everyone with an understandable case of “trust issues.”

Although Neve Campbell sits out this latest film, Courteney Cox returns along with Hayden Panettiere, which mostly serves as an excuse for a wide assortment of callbacks and winks toward “Screams” past. Still, given the focus on the younger contingent, the baton feels as if it has been passed.

As usual, the fewer questions asked the better, starting with how much blood someone can lose from multiple stab wounds and still be ambulatory. But enough of the jokes land to tickle hard-core fans, and the producers did themselves an enormous favor with the pairing of Barrera and Ortega, who bring just the right mix of eyebrow-arched cynicism, genuine chemistry and last-girl badassery to their sister act.

Directors Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett return to the helm, and despite the limits associated with this sort of exercise, their affection for the franchise is clearly evident.

After three “Scream” movies in four years starting in 1996, the franchise took a break until 2011 (then featuring Panettiere), with a similar gap until last year’s revival.

Although the layoff helps explain the enthusiasm that greeted “V,” it’s naïve to think “Scream” will again experience lengthy periods of dormancy. Because for a franchise that likes to talk about the rules of horror, they don’t articulate the bottom-line consideration here: That is, as long as you can keep reliably luring people to theaters, there’s not a ghost of a chance that you’ll be gone for long, any more than you need to worry about running out of bodies or Roman numerals.

Jennifer Lawrence is going full on comedy.

Sony has released the trailer for her forthcoming movie, “No Hard Feelings.” In the film, Lawrence plays a woman named Maggie, who in order to save her home, takes a job that entails trying to seduce a shy 19-year-old.

The R-rated trailer is NSFW (though it may depend on where you work) and opens with Lawrence having some financial issues before she answers an ad from some helicopter parents looking to bring their son out of his shell.

Upon meeting the young man, Percy, played by Andrew Barth Feldman at a pet adoption center she asks him, “Mind if I touch your wiener?” as he cradles a Dachshund, which are known as wiener dogs.

See what they did there?

Lawrence is one of the producers for the project, which also stars Matthew Broderick. The comedy is directed by Gene Stupnitsky.

Queer icon RuPaul says the slew of new legislation throughout the country looking to restrict or prohibit drag show performances is the work of “bullies.”

In an Instagram Reel posted to RuPaul’s verified account on Wednesday, the Emmy-winner said the anti-drag bills are “a classic distraction technique” turning the focus away from the real issues that lawmakers were voted into office to tackle.

Those real issues, RuPaul said, are job security, healthcare and “keeping our children safe from harm at their own school.”

“But we know that bullies are incompetent at solving real issues,” RuPaul said. “They look for easy targets so they can give the impression of being effective. They think our love, our light, our laughter and our joy are signs of weakness. But they’re wrong, because that is our strength.”

RuPaul is host of “RuPaul’s Drag Race,” a drag competition show that has been on the air since 2009 and won 26 Primetime Emmys. The show is often credited for bringing awareness of drag performance to a larger audience and, in turn, helping destigmatize the LGBTQ+ community.

RuPaul went on to say that drag queens “are the Marines of the queer movement.”

“Don’t get it twisted and don’t be distracted,” RuPaul added, before urging people to register to vote “so we can get these stunt queens out of office and put some smart people with real solutions into government.”

The TV personality’s statements come as anti-drag bills in at least 11 states across the country are working their way through legislatures, according to a CNN review.

The bills are being pushed forth mostly in Republican-led states. Politicians in those states claim drag performances expose children to sexual themes and imagery that are inappropriate.

The claim has been rejected by advocates, who say the proposed measures are discriminatory against the LGBTQ community and could violate First Amendment laws.CNN —

Jenna Ortega’s first order of business as the next host of “Saturday Night Live” is to escape the “teenage purgatory” of performing the iconic “Wednesday” dance yet again.

In a new “SNL” promo released on Wednesday, of course, Ortega looks at a script as she speaks to Ben Marshall, John Higgins and Martin Herlihy, the Please Don’t Destroy Boys comedy trio.

“Honestly, this is really well written, I just don’t feel like I want to do the ‘Wednesday’ dance for promo because we’ve seen so much of that already and I think it’s time to do something new,” Ortega says.

The PDD Boys agree with Ortega, until the camera pans out to reveal they’re dressed “down to the frill” in Wednesday Addams-inspired black dresses and braided wigs. After pretending like they don’t know the “Wednesday” dance at all and had no intention of filming it for the promo, Ortega finally agrees to go along with their poorly masked desire to indeed do the dance.

In true Wednesday Addams fashion, Ortega stoically performs a snippet of the dance on the iconic “SNL” stage in between Higgins and Marshall while Herlihy captures the moment on a smartphone.

The “Wednesday” dance took on a life of its own when it went viral on social media after the scene appeared in the Netflix show late last year.

The “SNL” promo comes on the heels of an interview in which Ortega spoke about how she’d frequently change her character’s lines during “Wednesday’s” production, which spurred mixed reactions from those in the television industry.

“SNL” airs live Saturday at 11:30pm EST/8:30pm PST on NBC and streams live on Peacock. Ortega is this week’s host with The 1975 as the musical guest.CNN —

Lukas Gage is aware people are wondering if he is dating celebrity hairstylist Chris Appleton.

Everyone can keep wondering for now.

In an interview with the New York Times, it was noted that the 27-year-old “White Lotus” star had just returned from vacationing in Mexico with Appleton, 39.

The interviewer pointed out that some people took the social media photos they posted of their vacay “as a relationship announcement,” to which Gage replied, “If they want to think that, they can.”

“I’m a pretty open book about most things in my life, but I have a problem with the culture of everyone needing to know everybody’s business and nothing can be sacred,” he said. ” It’s a weird line that I’m still trying to figure out.”

He was more open about his desire to land a role on the hit Netflix series, “You,” which he eventually did as he currently stars in Season 4.

“I think I had auditioned for every single season of “You” and didn’t get it until then. I auditioned for [star Penn Badgley’s serial killer character] Joe originally,” Gage said. “[I] played him like a mustache-twirling, villainous murderer, and the casting director was like, ‘Yeah, that’s totally tonally off, but thank you.’”"It Happened One Night" (1935): "It Happened One Night" was one of the great underdog winners. Its studio, Columbia, wasn't considered one of the majors at the time, and neither Clark Gable nor Claudette Colbert, its stars, were excited about the project. But it became the first film to sweep the five major categories of picture, actor, actress, director and screenplay. To this day, only two other films -- "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" (1975) and "The Silence of the Lambs" (1991) -- have pulled off the same trick. Columbia Pictures CorporationCNN —

Adam Driver has his fans, but he seems determined to test their loyalty with some of his recent film choices, the sci-fi thriller “65” being the latest among them. Although the title refers to how many million years ago Driver’s character visits Earth – encountering dinosaurs when he gets there – it could just as easily denote the score the movie earns on a scale of one to 200.

Driver still looks pretty human, but he’s actually an alien from long ago named Mills, who undertakes an exploratory mission before his spacecraft is struck by an asteroid and crash lands on Earth. The only other survivor is an orphaned young girl, Koa (Ariana Greenblatt), which, shades of “The Last of Us,” resonates because Mills left an ailing child behind when he embarked on the journey.

Koa essentially serves one basic purpose, giving Mills someone to talk to (even if they don’t speak the same language) and rescue from the jaws of hungry dinosaurs, as they schlep across the perilous landscape toward their one possible means of escape.

Adam Driver and Ariana Greenblatt stars in "65." Patti Perret/CTMG, Inc./Sony Pictures

Written and directed by the team of Scott Beck and Bryan Woods (whose writing credits include “A Quiet Place”), “65” somehow manages to include a lot of dinosaurs and still be fairly boring. Much of that has to do with the fact that practically every beat of the film is wildly predictable, including the arbitrary deadline the duo faces in terms of finding a way home.

Driver certainly remains much in demand for leading-man roles, and he has exhibited an eclectic appetite in that regard. Yet after his Oscar-nominated turn in “Marriage Story” the tale of the tape has been pretty bleak, including “Annette,” “House of Gucci,” “White Noise” and now this tepid thrill ride, raising the question of whether it’s time for him to become a bit more choosy.

Charitably, “65” can be viewed as an old-fashioned throwback to the kind of “B” movies that flourished about 65 years ago, just graced with the modern techniques now available for bringing ancient creatures to life.

That said, there’s a reason such films have, in theatrical terms, been pushed to the brink of extinction, and “65” represents such an uninspired effort as to look like a fossil even before the credits roll.

Over a career spanning four decades, Michelle Yeoh has been disarming audiences with her physical prowess as a martial artist and her emotive talent as an actor.

While she became an international icon 23 years ago, thanks to Ang Lee’s Oscar-winning “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,” it wasn’t until last year’s “Everything Everywhere All at Once” that she gained recognition from the Academy with her first Oscar nomination.

Here is a look back at some of Yeoh’s career highlights.

‘Yes, Madam!’ (1985)

A formidable entry in Yeoh’s early years of making movies in Hong Kong, this rock-‘em-sock-‘em action film is notable for its prominent placement of female actors rising up against the baddies, clearly paving the way for later opuses like Quentin Tarantino’s “Kill Bill” saga. “Yes, Madam!” is also a fun time capsule, maintaining a slightly goofy tone while featuring Yeoh in a pixie cut and giant ’80s shoulderpads.

‘Supercop’ (1992)

Yeoh shows off her martial-arts skills in this Hong Kong action-comedy opposite Jackie Chan, which received a dubbed release in the US. She played an Interpol inspector, and her role included truly harrowing stunt work – such as landing a motorcycle on a moving train, and in a few takes, dangerously skidding off of it – that was shown during the closing credits.

‘Wing Chun’ (1994)

A somewhat more stoic but still kinetic action-packed martial arts movie, it’s plain to see how “Wing Chun” allowed Yeoh to soar in the later classic “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.” It also marks one of Yeoh’s superior collaborations with legendary director and stuntman Woo-Ping Yuen, with whom she later worked on “Dragon” and other titles.

‘Tomorrow Never Dies’ (1997)

Yeoh played one of the most powerful Bond women, an equal to 007 in terms of smarts and strength. Much was made at the time of Yeoh – a former beauty queen-turned-actress – doing her own stunts in the Pierce Brosnan-starring film, as she kicked butt and won acclaim.

‘Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon’ (2000)

A dazzling international hit, memorable to many for its graceful wire-work action sequences, from director Ang Lee. Yeoh co-starred opposite Chow Yun-fat as two warriors unable to express their love for each other, with Zhang Ziyi as the thief they must battle for the possession a fabled centuries-old sword known as the Green Destiny.

‘Memoirs of a Geisha’ (2005)

Adapted from Arthur Golden’s novel, the story begins in the late 1920s, with Yeoh as Mameha, a fierce matriarch who schools her young protégé, Chiyo (again Zhang Ziyi) in the ways of serving as a geisha. The movie did generate some controversy at the time for casting non-Japanese actors, including Yeoh and Zhang, in the most prominent roles but their performances were praised.

‘The Lady’ (2011)

Based on the true story of Aung San Suu Kyi, Burmese politician and Nobel Peace Prize laureate, “The Lady” was a tour de force for Yeoh in the role of someone who stood up to violence and oppression. Directed by Luc Besson and costarring David Thewlis, the film is also a touching love story, earning Yeoh a best actress nomination for a Satellite Award.

‘Crazy Rich Asians’ (2018)

Yeoh portrayed a mother not to be played with in this 2018 film, the first major Hollywood movie to feature a majority Asian cast in 25 years (coming after “The Joy Luck Club” in 1993). Her character Eleanor Young is the sophisticated and tough-as-nails mom to main character Nick (Henry Golding), whose choice of girlfriend, Rachel (Constance Wu), Eleanor is less than thrilled with. She also plays a mean game of mahjong.

‘Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings’ (2021)

Yeoh joined the Marvel Cinematic Universe in the most graceful of styles, playing a mystical warrior who showed just how much of a dance martial-arts combat can really be. As the guardian of the magical realm known as Ta Lo, Yeoh’s whimsical character Ying Nan taught the men in the film, including Simu Liu’s titular hero Shang Chi, that success is not only borne from brute strength.CNN —

Pedro Pascal can handle the heat from a hot wing, but the summer sun on the “Games of Thrones” set was another story.

Before the actor was dodging mushroom zombies in “The Last of Us,” Pascal played Dornish heartthrob Oberyn Martell in Season 4 of “Game Of Thrones,” a character who infamously gets his eyes gouged out by Gregor “The Mountain” Clegane (Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson).

Barbaric as it was to watch, the “Mandalorian” star remembers it as “the best part of the day” in a new episode of hot wing interview show “Hot Ones.”

Pascal told “Hot Ones” host Sean Evans that he ended up falling “dead asleep” when filming the edge-of-your-seat moment. (“Game of Thrones” and “The Last of Us” are HBO shows. CNN and HBO are both part of the same parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery.)

(From left) Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson and Pedro Pascal in 'Game of Thrones.' HBO

“It was so hot when we were shooting that scene. He’s over me and he puts his thumbs into my eyes and they’ve got tubing through his body into his forearms to his thumbs just pumping this cool blood,” he said, adding that Björnsson was “the gentlest guy ever.”

Pascal said that the fake blood was “so cooling,” that when it was pumped all over his face “it was very cathartic and I went into the deepest sleep I’d been in.”

One good thing that came from this scene for Pascal is perhaps figuring out a sleep remedy.

“I realize now, because I’m not a very good sleeper, I need to be laid out with pieces of flesh, gelatinous, cool-to-the-touch face meat and pooling blood, and maybe I’ll finally get a good f**king night’s sleep,” the actor joked while taking in the heat of the chicken wing he was eating.

On second thought, maybe he should try counting sheep instead.CNN —

Grateful Academy Award recipients will once again be battling the clock on Sunday night as they give their acceptance speeches. And the men behind that timer – and the inevitable music that follows when it reaches zero – are prepared to make some tough calls.

Ahead of the Oscars, executive producers and showrunners Ricky Kirshner and Glenn Weiss said in an interview with CNN that trying to control the length of thank you speeches is a responsibility they take seriously.

“If you are giving a heartfelt, well-meaning speech, you will not get cut off,” Kirshner said. “If you start reading off your grocery list of what you need to do tomorrow, probably the music’s gonna come in.”

He likened himself and Weiss to a “coach and a quarterback,” saying that they “are on headsets all night, we kind of have a feel.” The pair have worked together for two decades, helming various big-tickets events between the two of them – from the Super Bowl Halftime show, to the Tonys, to past Academy Awards shows.

There are times, of course, when even the music can’t stop a winner from trying to make the most of their moment. On those instances, Kirshner said he has strong feelings.

“To be honest, it’s kind of rude to the people that come after,” he said. “We’re all professionals trying to do our job.”

He added: “We’re not trying to be rude.”

The battle over time on the awards stage is nothing new, but the ire has seemed louder than usual at times. At the Golden Globes in January, pianist Chloe Flower received backlash online – and even from award recipients – for playing the piano when she was instructed to. She clarified on Twitter, “I would never play piano over people’s speeches!! I’m only playing when you see me on camera!”

At the Oscars, Weiss said, a countdown clock helps winners keep track of time, and when it is up, words appear on the teleprompter asking them to “Please wrap it up.”

That’s when other measures need to be taken.

“Nobody – to say it clearly – wants to play music,” he said. “We hope that everyone respects (the time allotted), and if everybody does, there’s no music playing.”

As for other unscripted moments – whether it’s something small and silly like Ariana DeBose’s BAFTAs rap or major like last year’s infamous Oscars slap – Weiss and Kirshner along with their production team are trying to be prepared for practically anything that may happen during the telecast.

“We really do believe that what happens in the room translates on television,” Kirshner said. “Things happen. And that’s why we’re (working) in live television – because we love that.”CNN —

Steve Carell’s final days as Dunder Mifflin’s branch manager spanned a spectrum of emotions for the actor.

Carell played Michael Scott for seven seasons on the hit NBC documentary-style comedy before exiting the show in 2011, two seasons before the show’s series finale aired in 2013, and he said his farewell episode was tough to shoot.

“It was a really difficult episode to do but I also loved it at the same time because it was the end game for Michael,” Carell told his former “Office” co-stars Angela Kinsey and Jenna Fischer on Wednesday’s episode of their podcast “The Office Ladies.”

In the show, Carell’s Scott ends up leaving Dunder Mifflin for love, moving from Scranton, Pennsylvania to be with his on-screen fiancée, Holly Flax (Amy Ryan), in Colorado.

On this week’s podcast, Carell said that Scott’s departure “was the culmination showing the growth that he didn’t need the big sendoff, he didn’t need the big party. He could say goodbye to all of his friends on his own terms without the fanfare. I really enjoyed having that character evolve to that point in that moment.”

Rainn Wilson, who played fan-favorite character Dwight Schrute, told EW in 2011 that filming Carell’s final episode was “intense.”

“There actually wasn’t a dry eye in the house,” Wilson said, adding that “it was very difficult to make comedy when there was a heaviness hanging over the proceedings.”

Even though the sendoff was “emotional” for Carell, he told Fischer and Kinsey on the podcast that his tears were those of joy and that he wasn’t sad to leave, but rather he was “ready to go.”

“It was time for other characters to step to the forefront and other storylines to be pursued. The timing was right for everybody,” he said. “But simultaneously, there was just a sense of joy that we had experienced all of this. I was getting a chance to take a lap with everybody. I was simultaneously saying goodbye as Michael and us as friends in this moment of work together.”

During the show’s run, Carell led the 2007 movie “Dan in Real Life” and went on to star in other notable films after leaving “The Office,” such as “Foxcatcher” in 2014 – which earned him an Oscar nomination for best actor – and “The Big Short” the following year.

Kinsey said the reality of Carell’s departure came in “waves” and that they alternated between laughing and tearing up while filming his final episode.

While Carell was absent from appearing in Season 8 and Season 9, he did make a surprise uncredited appearance in “The Office’s” series finale in 2013 when he stood in as Dwight’s best man at his wedding.

“I think you can see it when you watch the show, there is a calm to it,” he said. “Everyone is loving each other in terms of us as actors and people beyond the characters.”CNN —

Goldie Hawn has enjoyed a vibrant career in Hollywood, but she admits she has at least one “regret.”

The star, who won an Oscar in 1970 for her role in 1969’s “Cactus Flower” but was unable to attend the ceremony, told Variety in an interview published on Wednesday that she wishes she’d gotten the full experience of winning the prestigious award.

“I never got dressed up. I never got to pick up the award,” she said. “I regret it.”

At the time, Hawn was in London sleeping, in preparation for an early call time for her next film.

The “Overboard” actress told the publication that she “forgot it was on television that night,” waking up when a reporter called in the early morning hours to seek her comment on winning.

After she hung up, she called her parents and “had a good cry.”

Fast forward to 2023, the star, now 77, said she only just recently saw footage from that particular Oscars telecast, and was surprised to see who read her name that night. Hawn said her friend Jimmy Kimmel – who is set to host this year’s Academy Awards on Sunday – asked her a few weeks ago if she ever saw “the part where you’re being announced by Fred Astaire?”

“‘Fred Astaire?!’” she remembered replying. “He’s my idol. And I didn’t know he was the one that announced my name. I got emotional when I finally saw it.”

Hawn graces the cover of the new issue of Variety.

Her most recent credit was in the film “The Christmas Chronicles: Part Two,” in which she stars alongside real-life partner Kurt Russell as Mrs. Claus and Santa Claus, respectively.CNN —

Watch out Deadpool, Wolverine is coming for you.

Hugh Jackman posted on his verified Instagram account photos of the meals he is eating to get ready to reprise his role as Wolverine, this time in “Deadpool 3,” opposite Ryan Reynolds.

“Bulking. A day in the life,” the caption on the photos reads. “Thank you Chef Mario for helping me stay healthy and properly fed whilst … Becoming. Wolverine. Again.”

The meals include black bass, chicken burgers, salmon and grass-fed sirloins.

The “X-Men” star recently told CNN’s Chris Wallace during an interview on “Who’s Talking to Chris Wallace” that he did not use steroids to achieve his cut, superhero physique, but rather “just did it the old school way.”

“And I tell you, I’ve eaten more chickens — I’m so sorry to all the vegans and vegetarians and to the chickens of the world,” Jackman said. “Literally the karma is not good for me. If the deity has anything related to chickens, I’m in trouble.”

Lisa Vanderpump was as shocked by the “Vanderpump Rules” cheating scandal as everyone else.

During an appearance Wednesday on “Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen,” Vanderpump said she was blindsided by news that cast members Tom Sandoval and Raquel Leviss had carried on a affair behind the back of Sandoval’s now ex-girlfriend, Ariana Madix.

“Gobsmacked, flabbergasted,” Vanderpump said when Cohen asked her reaction to the revelation. “I mean literally no words. I didn’t see it coming, nobody saw it coming.”

The controversy has been the talk of viewers of the show that bears her name. Vanderpump said she has seen Madix and filmed with her since the news broke. “Obviously, it’s an integral part of the story now,” she said.

“I would say the word I would use is ‘devastated,” Vanderpump said in expressing how Madix is doing. “A lot of tears. Ariana was always that ride or die girlfriend… it seems like Raquel was the ‘ride’ girlfriend [Ariana] was the ‘die’ girlfriend.”

The scandal has rocked the audience considering Leviss and Madix had been portrayed as close friends on the show, and Sandoval and Madix were a long-time couple.

Both Leviss and Sandoval have issued public apologies to Madix via social media.

Late Wednesday, Leviss also shared a statement on her verified Instagram account about the current status of her relationship with Sandoval, writing, “Besides the indefensible circumstances surrounding our relationship, my feelings for Tom have always been sincere and born out of a loving friendship.”

“Knowing how many people we hurt, I need to understand my choices and learn to make better ones,” the statement read. I need to take care of my health, work on self growth and take time to be ok with being alone.”

“I care for Tom and I don’t want to label anything or predict what lies ahead,” she added. “Right now I need to heal.”

Chris Evans and Ana de Armas are back in action.

Four years after co-starring in the 2019 murder mystery “Knives Out,” the actors have teamed back up in the Apple TV+ movie “Ghosted,” where they have to work their way out of a romantic gesture gone awry.

The trailer for “Ghosted” dropped on Monday and shows Evans and de Armas’s initial meet-cute, leading to what appears to be a hopeful first date.

“I know this sounds crazy but I think she might be the one,” Evans tells a friend in the trailer.

That hope fizzles once Evans comes to terms with the possibility that he’s been ghosted, a term used to describe a scenario in which a person cuts off communication without any explanation.

Evans then finds himself in London after a character, played by Amy Sedaris, urges him to “go to her.”

Once overseas, Evans learns his dream girl’s life is more complicated than he initially thought. After getting kidnapped and subsequently rescued by de Armas, she reveals she’s with the CIA. Chaos ensues as the couple is seen jumping out of a plane, traversing what looks like a deserted island and dodging bullets while dressed to the nines.

“You got me kidnapped and tortured all after one date,” Evans says to de Armas.

“You’re the one who flew to London,” de Armas replies.

De Armas has been busy lately. The “Blonde” actress was nominated for her first best actress Oscar for her role in the Marilyn Monroe biopic that started streaming on Netflix last year. Evans’ most recent project was the 2022 Netflix movie “The Gray Man.”

“Ghosted” will be available to stream on Apple TV+ on April 20.CNN —

When it comes to “Ted Lasso,” the show is often all-consuming for Jason Sudeikis.

As co-creator, executive producer and star of the hit Apple+ series, Sudeikis is always thinking about the show, its plot and characters, he tells CNN.

“This is literally what I do every day,” Sudeikis says. “I didn’t edit during production just because it was just too big of a load to carry with the writing and the acting, but then you know, being a producer, I was there on set every day going behind-the-scenes with notes, supporting our directors and our DP’s. When I go and watch, editing now, it’s a thrill. That’s a credit to the work that the writers did, but then also the way these actors portray them.”

Sudeikis says he shows up to set “excited to see” what the creative team on the series will pull off. The third and final season of “Ted Lasso,” which premieres on March 15, will delve even more into the characters’ backgrounds, Sudeikis adds, with inspiration coming from everywhere. For instance, he likes to encourage the cast to incorporate their real-life skills and talents into their characters.

“You know every person [on the show] has added something to it,” he says. “Sometimes it’s just what you hear people talking about, or a conversation I’ve had off-camera. An example of that would be Jeremy Swift, who plays Higgins, he and I are talking about music one day and he’s explaining to me his passion for jazz, now he plays standup bass, and I’m kinda like, ‘Oh, I think Higgins is gonna get his goatee back, his jazz goatee, and he’s gonna play that bass.’ And that’s just something I learned at Second City in Chicago, where you’re writing a show as an actor.”

Other times, “you stay open to it and just let the universe sort of lead the way,” he says.

Jason Sudeikis in "Ted Lasso." Season 3 debuts on Apple TV+ later this month. Apple TV+

Many ideas for “Ted Lasso,” Sudeikis says, have arrived in ways that he “couldn’t articulate.”

“It feels indulgent to say that, but I say it humbly,” he says. “It’s what athletes call ‘The Zone,’ it’s a real thing. And sometimes we only feel it in the 20 seconds when we first get in the shower.”

After that, he says, “we remember all there is to worry about,” in life.

Sudeikis says the show coming to a conclusion this season is bittersweet. He’s aware of a desire among viewers of the comedy for more.

“I look at that enthusiasm for [another season], which is not at all in existence or moving towards existence as of now, to be flattering,” he says. “We all do. But I also am like still, you know, eyes deep in season three. We’re still worried about this and going episode to episode. I didn’t know we were gonna get to do three seasons. None of us knew that this thing was going to take off the way it did, and people were going to respond to it the way they did.”

So is he saying there’s a chance for more folksy, observational wisdom from Ted in the future?

“If that which seemed impossible became possible, then maybe even the impossible can become possible,” Sudeikis replies.

Just when you thought Keanu Reeves couldn’t be any cooler.

During a recent Reddit Ask-Me-Anything (AMA), Reeves was asked if he had ever stolen anything from any of his many movie sets.

“Not stolen… the watch and wedding ring from John Wick, a sword from 47 Ronin, and the first red pill that the Wachowski’s ever gave me,” Reeves replied.

Yes, that means Reeves took the red pill from “The Matrix.”

The actor is currently promoting his latest “John Wick” film, the fourth in the franchise.

Both “The Matrix” franchise and the “John Wick” one have some overlap when it comes to the physicality. Both involved martial arts and Reeves was asked about the action.

“Nothing can ever compare to the kung fu training from the Matrix because it was so unique and my first time…but the jiu jitsu in John Wick being integrated with judo and gunfights can never be touched in its own way,” he said.

Reeves also answered a question about his aspirations had he not gotten into acting.

“Well, when I was a kid I always said I wanted to be a race car driver, a conductor or an astrophysicist,” he said. “Today, let’s conduct some music.”

Just don’t ask him his favorite film in which he has starred.

“I’ve been very fortunate to work on a few films that have changed my life. I can’t pick just one,” Reeves said. “But here are a few- ‘River’s Edge,’ ‘Bill and Ted’s Excellent Adventure,’ ‘Matrix’ trilogy, ‘The Devil’s Advocate,’ ‘A Scanner Darkly,’ ‘My Own Private Idaho,’ ‘Point Break,’ ‘John Wick’.CNN —

The success of last year’s “Janet Jackson” documentary means there’s more to come.

Lifetime and A&E announced Wednesday that the networks have greenlit a continuation of the story of the superstar’s life and career.

According to the networks, “Janet Jackson: Family First” will “chronicle the legendary singer, songwriter, producer, author, actor, philanthropist and global icon as she embarks on her 2023 “Together Again” tour, and her collaboration with brother Randy Jackson to reunite the family band after 40 years since their last performance.”

“Janet Jackson” was deemed a success after it was seen by 21 million viewers last year.

“I was touched by the love and support from the wonderful fans who enjoyed the documentary,” Jackson said in a statement. “I am excited to continue to share my story, and welcome fans into my life and the ‘Together Again’ tour. Thank you for your never-ending support, and I hope you enjoy the next chapter.”

The new documentary is currently filming and will follow the 2023 “Together Again” tour, which will celebrate Janet Jackson’s 50th anniversary in entertainment. It will also spotlight the milestones for two of Jackson’s most critically acclaimed albums – 25 years of “The Velvet Rope,” and 30 years of “janet.”CNN —

The Oscars are considered the highlight of awards season, but its categories are so rigid – best actress? Best costuming? How about freakiest killer doll nightmare and best performance by a donkey? We at CNN’s culture desk are honoring the best and most memorable movies of the year with our own awards that the Academy Awards won’t touch.

Best performance by a miniature pack animal

Jenny the Donkey as Jenny the Donkey in “The Banshees of Inisherin”

Maybe you were most moved by Colin Farrell’s tragic performance as an earnest dullard who loses his only human friend in the world in “Banshees,” or maybe you fell for Barry Keoghan’s even more tragic village idiot. But the film belongs to Jenny, Farrell’s beloved miniature donkey whom he allows to sleep inside against his sister’s wishes. She’s got spunk in spades, and her arc is perhaps the most devastating in a film full of suffering. (The authors of this piece did not see the donkey-led drama “EO,” up for best international feature at the Oscars, because they can only take so much trauma.)

Best running joke (?)

Austin Butler’s unrelenting “Elvis” accent

This is a man from Anaheim, California, who speaks not with a chill West Coast affect but with the syrupy drawl of a man born in Tupelo, Mississippi, and raised in Tennessee. Butler disappeared so fully into the role of one Elvis Presley that he can’t find his way back out, and so every acceptance speech he’s delivered this awards season is marked by the same inexplicable Southern accent. Never mind that “Elvis” finished filming years ago and was released more than eight months ago. (“Elvis” was released by Warner Bros., which like CNN, is a unit of Warner Bros. Discovery.)

Best arms

The Agojie, “The Woman King”

We don’t mean weapons – the cast of “The Woman King” hardly needs them. While their enemies fight with muskets, the women warriors of Dahomey – known as the Agojie – rely heavily on their impressive strength (aided by the occasional machete, spear or dangerously sharp fingernail). Viola Davis, Lashana Lynch, Thuso Mbedu and their co-stars got strong in real life to play the formidable members of the Agojie, and they receive ample screentime to show off their enviable muscle. The men of Marvel who bulk up for every movie have nothing on the cast of “The Woman King.”

Best dance sequence

TIE: Paul Mescal in “Aftersun” and “Naatu Naatu” in “RRR”

“Under Pressure” never sounded as emotionally shattering as it did in “Aftersun,” when Paul Mescal as a mercurial young father finally lets loose on the dance floor. His moves embarrass his preteen daughter at first, until she finally relents and dances with him, clinging tightly. It’s a cathartic, bittersweet moment in a film whose heartbreaking ending is telegraphed from the start.

Meanwhile, in the runaway hit from India, “RRR,” a massive mob of extras break out into a raucous and joyous dance sequence set to “Naatu Naatu.” The song became the earworm of awards season – apologies to Lady Gaga and Rihanna, who also made admirable attempts with their original songs (and, like the artists behind “Naatu Naatu,” earned Oscar noms this year).

Best use of rocks

“Everything Everywhere All At Once”

Admit it, you heard sniffles in the theater during the rock scene – when Michelle Yeoh’s Evelyn confronts her daughter/multiversal nemesis (Stephanie Hsu) while they’re small stones, overlooking the Grand Canyon. As rocks, they discuss the unending vastness of the universe and how meaningless it can make their lives feel. For a film whose props include hot dog fingers and puppet raccoons, it’s a deep idea to ponder. Who knew throwing some googly eyes on a glorified pebble could make even the most stoic among us weep?

Best whale

“Avatar: The Way of Water”

Disney

OK, so the Tulkun in James Cameron’s “Avatar” sequel are not exactly whales as we know them, but the massive water-dwelling creatures are the closest species Pandora has to Earth’s largest mammal. Even if you weren’t enchanted by the latest chapter of Jake Sully’s Na’vi adventures, chances are you were still moved by the death of the first-time mom Tulkun who composed songs. There is, of course, another whale film in contention this year, but these authors decline to comment further.

Best ‘dandy on vacation’ wardrobe

Daniel Craig’s leisurewear in “Glass Onion”

The culprit behind the murder in “Knives Out” followup “Glass Onion” was plain to see from the jump, but Daniel Craig’s Southern detective Benoit Blanc was anything but plainly dressed in the island-set romp. Speaking of romps, Craig sported an especially memorable blue-and-white vertical striped romper with a citrine ascot and sensible sandals in a pool-side scene. His summertime casual attire was the highlight of an otherwise middling mystery.

Best onscreen food

Cheeseburger, “The Menu”

Though neither writer is particularly fond of cheese or red meat, we, too, would take a Shake Shack knock-off over broken emulsions, tortillas featuring our tax records and, of course, the threat of death. Plus, it’s not every day that a cheeseburger saves you from getting burned alive with your imbecile of a date and a bunch of pretentious rich people. What other menu item can say that?

Best AI-fueled nightmare

“M3gan”

A horror movie about a murderous AI doll being released at the same time AI-powered ChatGPT is all over the news and Bing’s AI chatbox admits its secret desire to spread misinformation is enough to make us want to press restart on this whole planet. If we learned one thing from “M3gan,” it’s that we should leave AI in sci-fi novels.

Best buddy to brave an alien invasion with

Keke Palmer in “Nope”

The award says it all. From the second Palmer marches onscreen in “Nope,” she had us in shambles – deftly toeing the line between boisterous younger sister and cunning entrepreneur. “Nope” isn’t even a comedy, but every line and bewildered expression from Palmer was a delight. If the aliens ever do choose to make a visit, may we have Palmer at our side.

Best attempt at a provocative statement

“Tár”

Cate Blanchett in "Tár" -- was it an allegory? A faux-biopic? A diatribe against cancel culture? Or just another Oscar vehicle for one of the greatest actresses of our time? Courtesy of Focus Features

Were we supposed to feel bad for Cate Blanchett’s Lydia Tár, a renowned conductor whose life falls apart in the midst of sexual misconduct allegations? Were we meant to laugh when she bullies a student, a self-described “BIPOC pangender person”? And, if so, is it at her cutting comments or at the student’s buzzword-laden self-description? We aren’t really sure!!!!! “Tár” is, we think, trying to say something, but months later, we still don’t know what. And that in itself is truly a triumph.

Best blonde

Andrea Riseborough, “To Leslie”

There were multiple blondes vying for this category, but our hearts led us to surprise nominee Riseborough and her messy blonde mop with grown-out roots. We know some may think a certain Marilyn Monroe rendition deserved this title, but half of Hollywood wanted Riseborough to win in this specific category for this specific CNN Faux-Oscars Awards. And who are we to deny the people?

Best pro-war movie

“Top Gun: Maverick”

We can’t lie, watching “Top Gun: Maverick” did make us wonder if we should switch careers and become fighter pilots. Like, come on, you get to fly super fast while also playing football on the beach with all your newfound best friends? Plus you get a cool nickname?? Sign us up.

Best anti-war movie

“All Quiet on the Western Front”

The intense German film left no stone unturned when it came to the horrors of war, even when we wished it did. (Did we really need to see that man blow up??? Did we??) Though brutal, this adaptation of the classic novel did present a harrowing look at life as a soldier in WWI, while also reminding us to brush up on our AP World History. Get you a girl who can do both!

Best emotional roller coaster

“Black Panther: Wakanda Forever”

This movie has everything. In mere minutes, you’re crying with Shuri (Letitia Wright) over the death of her brother, gasping as Ramonda (Angela Bassett) snaps at Europeans trying to steal vibranium, and giggling at Mbaku’s (Winston Duke) quips. “Black Panther” is nearly three hours of up and down and up and down and up again. We wouldn’t have it any other way.

Best menstrual metaphor

“Turning Red”

A Pixar movie that presents periods as a regular part of growing up and embraces puberty rather than making kids feel ashamed of their changing bodies and feelings? All the awards! May we all be as bold as a 13-year-old learning to healthily navigate her emotions.CNN —

The 95th Academy Awards are just about a week away, which means there’s still time to watch some of the nominated films and performances.

Many of the movies on the Oscars ballot are now available on streaming services. The multiverse-hopping opus “Everything Everywhere All at Once” – leading the pack with 11 nominations – can be viewed on Showtime Anytime.

Netflix is the place to watch “All Quiet on the Western Front,” with nine nominations to its name, while HBO Max offers viewers “The Banshees of Inisherin” – also with nine nods – as well as “Elvis,” just behind those with eight. (CNN and HBO Max are both part of the same parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery.)

If Oscar-nominated blockbusters are more your speed, Disney+ has you covered with “Avatar: The Way of the Water,” up for best picture among other categories, and “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,” starring record-setting Oscar nominee Angela Bassett.

This year, all the best picture nominees are available for streaming in fact, either via subscription or for paid on-demand rental. An exhaustive list follows.

Recognizing the inevitably hit-miss nature of sketch comedy, the main question for “History of the World, Part II” is whether the Hulu series yields enough good stuff to justify this extension of the 1981 movie from Mel Brooks, rightfully billed here as an “American treasure.” The show squeaks by, barely, though this is one of those exercises where a little fast-forwarding through “History” couldn’t hurt.

To its credit the series generally matches the irreverence of the original, which was produced in a different comedy era, testing whether it’s possible to still be that proudly offensive. Brooks (now 96, incidentally) introduces the show and the various sketches, which feature an assortment of regulars and guests that includes Nick Kroll, Ike Barinholtz and Wanda Sykes, who, along with Brooks, serve as executive producers.

Musical numbers play a role in the merriment, another Brooks staple, although there’s nothing that quite rivals the giddy absurdity of a song-and-dance routine devoted to the Spanish Inquisition.

Much of the comedy involves updating the gags through the current media moment, from ESPN-style sideline interviews with General Grant during the Civil War to “The Real Concubines of Kublai Khan.”

“History of the World” also revels in inside-showbiz humor, such as William Shakespeare (Josh Gad) running a TV writers’ room, or cheekily filtering the story of Jesus through a movie studio that turns it into what looks like a Rambo movie, down to the trailer’s muscular hero.

Perhaps of necessity, the show fleshes out the episodes by returning to the same sketches multiple times, from a “Fiddler on the Roof”-inspired ode to Russia during the revolution to a ’70s-style sitcom featuring Wanda Sykes as one-time presidential candidate Shirley Chisholm (titled “Shirley,” naturally), complete with an overbearing laugh track.

Not surprisingly, “History of the World” leans into low-brow fare, such as a reenactment of the D-Day invasion that turns into perhaps the longest vomiting scene since “Team America: World Police.”

Brooks might be an “American treasure,” but the first “History of the World” – which followed his most memorable creative and commercial stretch in the 1970s – isn’t exactly fodder for the time capsule, something to keep in mind appraising this version. Hulu will drop the eight half-hours in pairs over successive days, an interesting strategy for a project that doesn’t need to be consumed in any particular order.

On the plus side, the show has no obvious aspirations beyond following the first commandment of comedy – be funny – and if the series does well enough to merit a “Part III,” Brooks and company certainly won’t suffer from a lack of material. After all, they have the whole “World” in their hands.

“History of the World, Part II” premieres March 6 on Hulu.CNN —

As soap operas set against the world of sex, drugs and rock ‘n’ roll go, “Daisy Jones & the Six” is a by-no-means groundbreaking but still-enjoyable account of the best band that never existed, charting its meteoric rise and just-as-abrupt fall. Credit that in part to the cast, starting with Riley Keough, who does her rock lineage and grandpa Elvis proud by belting out the group’s songs.

Each episode (or “track”) uses the title of a vintage song, while employing a faux-documentary-style format as the band members look back, 20 years later, at how they came together in the 1970s, before suddenly breaking up at the top of their game.

The Amazon series is adapted from Taylor Jenkins Reid’s novel, which used Fleetwood Mac as a source of inspiration. But the show mostly works by charting its own course, namechecking cultural artifacts of its era (Barry Manilow and “Rollerball” among them) while more narrowly focusing on the band, with all the festering resentments and simmering attractions that go with the creative process.

At the heart of that lies Keough’s Daisy Jones, a musical force with a mercurial temper who, thanks to the insight of a record executive (Tom Wright), is thrown together with up-and-coming band the Six (there are actually five of them), an ambitious group out of Pittsburgh led by frontman Billy Dunne (Sam Claflin).

Billy winds up marrying his girlfriend (Camila Morrone) for the most rock-star-ish of reasons, but it’s difficult to ignore all that sexual tension with Daisy, which adds a combustible quality to their collaborations – both as songwriters and on stage – in the mesh of their sensibilities, while constantly threatening to the group’s interpersonal dynamics.

Then again, that’s only one of the problematic issues baked into the Six’s interactions, with every source of friction exacerbated by the temptations associated with fame and fortune.

“We didn’t really understand addiction back then,” the group’s lead guitarist, Eddie (Josh Whitehouse), acknowledges during the interviews, while Daisy asks the unseen documentarian – having promised to tell her everything – “How much of ‘everything’ do you really want to know?”

Inevitably, “Daisy Jones” feels derivative of any number of rock ‘n’ roll stories, and the egos and excess that go with them, from “Almost Famous” to the last two versions of “A Star is Born” to Tom Hanks’ ode to one-hit wonders “That Thing You Do.”

Fortunately, the characters in this ensemble are strong enough to carry the show through its season, even if the situations feel less than wholly distinctive.

“It was every band’s dream come true,” the tour manager, played by Timothy Olyphant, muses about the group’s heady brush with rock immortality, as filtered through the in-hindsight prism of its personality-driven collapse.

“Daisy Jones & the Six” doesn’t quite qualify as a dream come true, but it does turn its fictional story into a four-star soap, wistfully capturing this musical era broadly and the sometimes-fleeting nature of stardom. It’s a taste, as Fleetwood Mac put it, of “the stillness of remembering what you had, and what you lost.”

“Daisy Jones & the Six” premieres March 3 on Amazon’s Prime Video.Editor’s Note: The following contains spoilers about the eighth episode of “The Last of Us,” which premiered on March 5.

CNN —

As “The Walking Dead” and its progeny demonstrated time and again, people – left to their own devices in a lawless society – become the true monsters during a zombie apocalypse, a point made powerfully in the latest episode of “The Last of Us,” while demonstrating how tough, steely and resourceful the teenage Ellie can be.

With Joel (Pedro Pascal) still ailing, Ellie (Bella Ramsey) encountered David (Scott Shepherd), the leader of a starving community that he presides over as its spiritual guide as well as on a more basic level.

“It’s hard to trust strangers, I know,” David said when he first met Ellie, assuring her, “I’m a decent man.”

Yet despite a pleasant voice and sounding completely reasonable at first, David was exposed as a different kind of monster, resorting to cannibalism to feed his struggling flock, and eventually trying to sexually assault the teenage Ellie, who, thanks to her grit, he saw as a kindred spirit.

In one of the more horrific images the series has produced, first Ellie and then Joel witnessed the remnants of what David was relying upon for food, with the latter discovering a gruesome locker where bodies were being stored.

For her part, Ellie fought back after trading a deer for antibiotics in order to help Joel, who recovered enough to torture and kill several of David’s men in order to find her. She also brilliantly leveraged her immunity to the virus as a means of buying herself time when David was about to kill her, before cathartically saving herself with a visceral outburst of violence.

Almost surely by happenstance, the odd-numbered episodes of the series have generally been more memorable than the even ones, a pattern that persisted here. These last several chapters have been notable for the gradual evolution of the Joel-Ellie relationship, underscored when he finally found her at the hour’s end, telling the emotionally drained youth, “It’s OK, baby girl,” with a tenderness that stood in stark relief to the brutality on display otherwise.

Already a huge success for HBO (which, like CNN, is a unit of Warner Bros. Discovery) in terms of viewership and media buzz, the series has one more episode to essentially cement its credentials in terms the other priority associated with prestige-TV fare: Being remembered when Emmy awards season kicks into high gear this spring.

Aside from a rich roster of guest stars, Pascal and Ramsey might not have completely closed that deal given the historic hurdles faced by this genre on that front; still, with each of these last few hours, they continue to build upon what already appeared to be a pretty compelling case.CNN —

HBO’s dark revisionist version of “Perry Mason” didn’t reach its top tier of dramas in the first season but comes considerably closer in the second, achieving a film-noir-ish cool that leans deeply into “L.A. Confidential” territory. Filtering race, sexuality and the corrupting influence of wealth through a 1930s lens, the series feels more relevant and compelling as a glimpse of the present through that past.

After what amounted to a super-attorney origin story when the show premiered way back in 2020, the new episodes pick up months after that storyline, when a businessman connected to a powerful family is murdered. Eager for a conviction, the police arrest a pair of Latinx brothers (Fabrizio Guido, Peter Mendoza), pressing a case that exposes the not-even-veiled racism practiced by the police and district attorney’s office.

Mason (Matthew Rhys, an Emmy nominee for the show) takes the case, which leads down a twisted rabbit hole filled with eccentric captains of industry and shady deals that starkly illustrates the divide between rich and poor, and the different levels of justice that entails.

“I just see it as making things fair,” Mason says at one point of his tilting at windmills, but as the murdered man’s power broker dad (Paul Raci) warns him as the attorney pokes around in his business seeking to exonerate his clients, “Even when you win, Mr. Mason, you lose.”

Once again, the court case plays out against a backdrop that includes the limitations of life 90 years ago, with Mason’s able right hand Della Street (Juliet Rylance) and the D.A., Hamilton Burger (Justin Kirk), both leading closeted existences, with the latter’s secrets making him vulnerable to blackmail.

Mason’s personal life also remains something of a mess as he navigates his divorce, tries to look after his son and in doing so meets a new woman (Katherine Waterston), not that he has a whole lot of time for that.

As noted when the show premiered, the similarities between the familiar TV version of “Perry Mason” (RIP, Raymond Burr) and this gritty take pretty much begin and end with the name, but the emphasis on a trial brings it somewhat closer to the formula. The series is also populated with a topnotch cast, including Chris Chalk as Mason’s investigator Paul Drake, and Shea Whigham and Eric Lange as the kind of hard-bitten characters one might find in an old James Cagney movie.

Understandable skepticism greeted “Perry Mason” when HBO rolled it out, and despite its intriguing pieces, a second season seemed iffy based on the first, surrounded as it is by higher-profile HBO dramas. Credit the producers with upping their game, delivering a show that indeed makes it possible that even if Perry loses, the viewers win.

Chris Rock finally addressed the Oscars slap and made Netflix history on Saturday, with the platform’s first live global streaming event.

“I’m going to try to do a show tonight without offending nobody. I’m going to try my best, because you never know who might get triggered,” Rock said as he opened his set from Baltimore. “People always say words hurt … anybody who says words hurt has never been punched in the face.”

After that quick apparent reference to Will Smith slapping him on stage at last year’s Academy Awards, Rock saved his jokes about the incident until the last ten minutes of the show.

“You all know what happened to me, getting smacked by Suge Smith,” Rock said. “It still hurts. I got ‘Summertime’ ringing in my ears. But I’m not a victim, baby. You’ll never see me on Oprah or Gayle crying … I took that hit like Pacquiao.”

Rock suggested Smith’s response to his Oscars joke about his wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, was more about their relationship than him.

“I love Will Smith, my whole life,” Rock said. “I have rooted for Will Smith my whole life … now I watch ‘Emancipation’ just to see him get whupped.”

Smith plays an enslaved man in the period drama, “Emancipation.”

“‘How come you didn’t do nothing back that night?’” Rock said people have asked him. “Because I got parents. You know what my parents taught me? Don’t fight in front of White people.”

Titled “Chris Rock: Selective Outrage,” the comedian hit on a wide range of topics in the first 50 minutes of the special, including addiction, abortion, racism in America, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, the Kardashian family and “wokeness.”

“I have no problem with the wokeness. I have no problem with it at all. I’m all for social justice. I’m all for marginalized people getting their rights. The thing I have a problem with is the selective outrage,” Rock said. “You know what i’m talking about. One person does something, they get canceled. Somebody else does the exact same thing, nothing. You know what I’m talking about … the kind of people who play Michael Jackson songs but won’t play R. Kelly. Same crime, one of them just has better songs.”

Tackling the country’s division, Rock said, “America is in horrible shape right now.”

“We got it worse than Ukraine. Yeah, I said it. You know why? Because Ukraine is united and America is clearly divided,” Rock joked. “If the Russians came here right now, half the country would say, ‘Let’s hear them out.’ We’re in a bad place right now.”

Rock also delved into his romantic life, saying when he noticed his pillow cases were dirty, he realized how much women do for men.

“I’m trying to date women my age, which is 10 to 15 years younger than me,” he said. “Don’t hate the player, hate the game. I didn’t get rich and stay in shape to talk about Anita Baker. I’m trying to f— Doja Cat.”

The performance was Rock’s sixth standup special and his second for Netflix after 2018’s “Tamborine,” directed by Bo Burnham.

A pre-show event kicked off with comedian Ronny Chieng live from Los Angeles, where he told the crowd, “We could have pretaped this whole thing and nobody would have cared, but we are doing this for a noble cause: To finally try to kill off traditional TV and put it out of its misery. In fact, if you listen hard you can hear Baby Boomers canceling the last cable subscription packages.”

There was also a post-show special with comedians Arsenio Hall, Dana Carvey, David Spade, Yvone Orji and more.CNN —

Ant-Man is a somewhat ironic choice for a very, very big job: Kicking off the next phase of Marvel movies. “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” works on one key level, establishing Kang the Conqueror as a truly formidable and worthy villain. Yet with its plunge into inner space, “Ant-Man” comes up short in almost every other way that matters.

Actually, the rapid descent into the Quantum Realm, a sprawling universe within our own, makes this feel as much like “Guardians of the Galaxy” as Ant-Man, with a vast assortment of strange characters and outlandish, otherworldly and too often murky production design.

With much of the action unfolding on that plane, the movie bears scant resemblance to the original “Ant-Man,” or even its sequel, which overcame its potentially mockable premise with plenty of comedy and a modestly scaled story.

Director Peyton Reed is back for the third time, and the movie begins with a similar sense of whimsy, but similarities to the franchise’s 2015 introduction pretty much end there.

“Quantumania,” by contrast, has a bad case of gigantism, as Paul Rudd’s Ant-Man/Scott Lang is drawn into the Quantum Realm along with the Wasp (Evangeline Lilly), her parents (Michelle Pfeiffer and Michael Douglas) and Scott’s now-grown daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton, a nice addition to a family of heroes that keeps growing through shrinking).

What ensues is an especially psychedelic trip, with precious little grounding in anything that resembles recognizable reality. The most identifiable aspect involves this hidden universe chafing under the rule of a being so powerful that its occupants exhibit a Voldemort-like reluctance to even speak his name, that being Kang the Conqueror, played by Jonathan Majors.

Although he made an appearance in Marvel’s “Loki” TV series, that didn’t prepare audiences for the Thanos-level threat that Kang represents, and Majors invests him with quiet menace and majesty – a sense of gravitas that’s no small feat given the contours of some of the dialogue. If Kang is destined to become the central antagonist as the next batch of movies again build toward an Avengers-sized showdown, Majors is the one thing to emerge from “Quantumania” on which anyone could hang their hat.

One structural problem, in fact, is that Kang’s power and the scope of his evil plans make the hero-villain pairing feel like a decided mismatch – to couch it in terms suited to Majors’ upcoming role in “Creed III,” asking a lightweight to go toe-to-toe with a heavyweight, one that got his start in the comics sparring with the Fantastic Four. It’s a point overtly made by Kang himself, who sneers at Ant-Man, “You’re out of your league.”

A global pandemic, obviously, significantly altered the theatrical playing field for everyone in Hollywood after Marvel’s smashing success with “Avengers: Endgame,” but the studio hasn’t felt like quite as much like a big-league player since that climactic event.

Thanks to its emphasis on Kang, the third “Ant-Man” has taken a necessary step toward something bigger, with the aforementioned “Guardians” and “The Marvels” sequels still to come this year. But it is, at best, a small step, and like much of Marvel’s recent output, only makes “Endgame” loom that much larger in the rearview mirror.

When David “Trugoy the Dove” Jolicoeur of influential rap group De La Soul died last month, fans who wished to hear their work on music streaming services would have been unable to do so due to legal and copyright issues.

But on Friday, De La Soul’s first six albums spanning from 1989 to 2001 finally debuted on Spotify, Apple Music, Tidal and similar music services.

De La Soul’s digital arrival is the culmination of a decades-long battle against copyright constraints and multiple labels, including Tommy Boy Records, the group’s first. The Tommy Boy music catalog was acquired by Reservoir Media in 2021, opening an avenue for the group to appear on streaming.

“The first call we made was to De La Soul,” Reservoir executive Faith Newman said after the acquisition. “We vowed to bring their music to streaming, and it means the world to our team to make good on that promise and expose a whole new generation of listeners to one of the most important catalogs in hip-hop history.”

The pioneering group was formed in 1988 by Jolicoeur, Kelvin “Posdnuos” Mercer and Vincent “Pasemaster Mase” Mason after they attended high school together in Amityville, New York.

Their debut album, 1989’s “3 Feet High and Rising,” is widely credited for its influential, sample-heavy conceptual sound, and included the hit “Me, Myself and I,” which spent 17 weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.

De La Soul’s sampling artistry made digitizing the catalog they built over their career a monumental task, as samples previously cleared for use on vinyl, cassettes and CDs had to be redone for streaming.

The complexity of the group’s work was not the only item holding it back from entering the digital medium. Ownership of their music catalog changed hands several times over the last two decades, and Mercer, Mason and Jolicoeur were outspoken about issues they had with the terms of their Tommy Boy contract.

But the loss of Jolicoeur has made this moment of success bittersweet for the other members. In a heartfelt tribute to Jolicoeur posted on Instagram last week, Mason wrote, “I’m extremely upset at the fact that you’re not here to celebrate and enjoy what we worked and fought so hard to achieve.”

Mason promises he and Mercer “will make sure your legacy is well preserved. ‘We Are De La Soul’ for life and after life, but obviously, it will never be the same.”

Over the course of their performing career, De La Soul was nominated for six Grammy Awards, winning one for best pop collaboration with vocals for the Gorillaz song “Feel Good Inc.” in 2006.

In 2010, the Library of Congress added “3 Feet High and Rising” to the National Recording Registry, the permanent archive of sound recordings considered “culturally, historically or aesthetically significant.” The album is one of only 13 “Rap/Hip-Hop” recordings in the registry.

“The Magic Number,” another song off “3 Feet High and Rising,” was featured as the end-credit song in “Spider-Man: No Way Home” in 2021.

“We’ve been very resilient, even being a group that didn’t have our music up [on streaming platforms]. We still had these beautiful opportunities through young people finding out about us through a commercial or Spider-Man,” Mercer is quoted as saying in Reservoir’s biography of the group.

De La Soul has “naturally been that group for everyone,” Mercer said. “It was never about ‘we’re just here for this community, that community, this set of people or these certain fans of hip-hop culture.’ We see music as music.”CNN —

Megan Piphus Peace has always found magic in puppets.

The self-trained ventriloquist and puppeteer grew up watching the sock puppets on “Lamb Chop’s Play-Along,” the hand puppets of “Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood,” and the muppets of “Sesame Street.” As a child, the characters seemed so alive, and it was only later that she learned what it took to create that sense of reality.

“Puppets allow us to enter the imagination of a child,” Piphus Peace told CNN. “You think of a child playing. Their toys can talk. Their cars can move. So you’re speaking their imaginative and creative language when you’re allowing a puppet to come to life.”

Ever since Piphus Peace discovered that puppetry could be an art form, it’s been a passion – one that she’s pursued throughout her life. These days, she’s the voice of 6-year-old Gabrielle on “Sesame Street,” and the first Black woman puppeteer in the show’s more than 50-year history.

Puppetry became a passion

Piphus Peace learned about puppeteering early on.

When she was 10, a woman at her church wanted to start a puppetry team to perform for the children in the congregation, and assembled a group to attend a puppetry conference. There, Piphus Peace was inspired by the female performers she saw – so much so that when she came home, she told her parents she wanted to be a ventriloquist.

“Onstage, you got to see the interaction between a human and an inanimate object that was coming to life,” Piphus Peace said. “That just had so much magic to me, and I wanted to do the same.”

Her parents were incredibly supportive, she said, and helped her find a puppet and videotapes of ventriloquists for her to learn from. Soon, she was performing for her classmates, and then the entire elementary school.

“I realized how you can captivate the attention of a child with a puppet,” she said. “My soul was just lifted by being able to make kids anywhere from kindergarten to sixth grade smile and laugh.”

During her teenage years, Piphus Peace performed across her hometown of Cincinnati and around the country. Her talents were also on display during her high school valedictorian speech, earning her the nickname “Valedictorian Ventriloquist.” As a college student at Vanderbilt University, she became known as the “Vanderbilt Ventriloquist,” appearing on “The Tonight Show with Jay Leno” in 2012 and on “America’s Got Talent” in 2013.

After getting her undergraduate degree in 2014 and a master’s of science in finance in 2015, Piphus Peace embarked on a career in real estate finance. But all the while, she kept pursuing her interests in ventriloquism and puppetry. She would wake up early to write material, practice in the evenings after work and find opportunities to perform on the weekends.

“I just couldn’t give up the feeling of making audiences smile,” she said.

How she got to Sesame Street

In 2020, Piphus Peace said she was contacted by “Sesame Street” performers Matt Vogel and Martin Robinson, who asked if she’d be willing to learn the signature muppet-style puppetry of the show.

It was definitely an adjustment, Piphus Peace said. She was used to doing stage ventriloquism, which involved interacting with puppets without moving the lips. Muppet-style puppetry meant keeping the body out of the camera frame and using monitors to see how the puppets looked on screen.

She was also working a full-time job and happened to be pregnant with her second child. But she honed her skills in the mornings before work and in the evenings after putting her son to bed. She sent videos to Vogel and Robinson, who in turn would send feedback and notes on her performances. She also joined the “Sesame Street” mentorship program, and practiced puppeteering with fellow mentees.

Later that year, Piphus was asked to play Gabrielle in a CNN and “Sesame Street” town hall on racism. It was a daunting prospect for her first “Sesame Street” appearance – she would be a part of helping children process George Floyd’s killing and the Black Lives Matter protests. But she said having the support of seasoned “Sesame Street” veterans got her through.

“For my first experience with ‘Sesame Street,’ (we were) covering something so necessary in the community and a very necessary discussion,” she said.

In 2021, she joined “Sesame Street” as a full-time cast member. But it was by happenstance that she discovered she was a trailblazer.

Piphus Peace was at the famed Kaufman Astoria Studios in Queens, New York, for her first in-person recording of the show when she came across a wall decorated with photos of the cast and crew. As she looked at the faces of the puppeteers that came before her, she noticed none were Black women.

She asked if there had been other Black female puppeteers on “Sesame Street,” and a producer later informed her that she was the first.

“I realized in that moment that I had made history in a show that had already been around for over 50 years,” Piphus Peace said. “I realized that it would open doors for other Black women, women of color, little boys of color, entering the entertainment space to really see that they can be absolutely anything – no matter how niche or unique.”

Sweeping the clouds away

Through her character Gabrielle, Piphus Peace has been able to model joy, curiosity and self-love for a new generation of “Sesame Street” viewers.

“Gabrielle is a sweet, 6-year-old Black girl muppet,” she said. “She loves everything about her community and her friends. Gabrielle loves to sing and to dance, and she’s had lots of experiences on ‘Sesame Street’ where she’s gotten to sing about colors, about loving her hair.”

While Piphus Peace was a shy child, Gabrielle is the confident girl that she aspired to be, she said. And she hopes that Gabrielle can serve as an inspiration to other kids.

“I hope that kids can learn that we all have beautiful unique differences, but in many ways we’re the same,” she said. “I hope that they learn an unwavering sense of self-confidence.”CNN —

The crime thriller “Mayor of Kingstown” could not be described as light, escapist television.

The Paramount+ series, now in its second season, explores themes of corruption, racism and inequality. It follows the McLusky family as they wield power in the fictional Kingstown, Michigan, where incarceration is the town’s thriving industry.

The drama is co-created by Taylor Sheridan, who also created the “Yellowstone” franchise, and producer Hugh Dillon, whose personal experience growing up in a Canadian town with several penitentiaries has helped shape the show.

“I’m interested in the ethical drift, I’m in interested in the desensitization of both the prisoners and the guards and the world,” Dillon, who also plays a detective on the show, told CNN in a recent interview. “That’s the town I’m from. So it has, it leaves an impact and we just dive into it.”

“Mayor of Kingstown” stars Jeremy Renner as the McLusky patriarch and the town’s “Mayor.” Actor Taylor Handley plays his brother.

“You know, a lot of other shows are nice and poetic, ‘Mayor of Kingstown’ punches you in the face and takes your lunch money,” Handley quipped. “While it is dark and it is violent, there’s so much heart with all the characters and you know, you really end up rooting for all these people.”

Though Renner was critically injured in a highly publicized snowplow accident last month, his colleagues said he is as tough as the character he plays on “Kingstown,” “rocking” his recovery.

“I heard from him 24 hours after the accident and he’s on the road to recovery,” Dillon said. “He’s a fighter and he’s just so funny. In the midst of this tragedy, he just wants to put you at ease.”

Handley recently visited Renner at his home.

“It’s crazy to think how big this story is. I mean, granted, you know, Jeremy is a huge personality, huge superstar,” Handley said.

“He’s just on track. I mean, you know, Hugh kind of hit it. He is a fighter and nothing’s slowing him down. He’s from Modesto, where they raise UFC fighters and lumberjacks. The man is just, you know, has got super human blood in him … there’s no stopping him.”

Earlier this week, Renner teased an upcoming project for Disney and joked that he was “in the shop now, working on me.”

Tobi Bamtefa, who plays Deverin “Bunny” Washington on the series, told CNN he is happy to see Renner’s recovery going so well.

“When I heard about [the accident], I was terrified. I was worried for his well-being … we immediately started praying,” Bamtefa said. “I sent him messages and my whole family has been praying for him. It’s good to see he’s on the mend, and we are praying for a stronger comeback from him.”

Meanwhile, the Season 2 sixth episode of “Mayor of Kingston,” which airs Sunday, has Bamtefa at the center.

“I believe the crux of this show is about humanity,” he said. “In this show and in this world of Kingstown, we are watching people placed in very extreme circumstances, it’s a prison town and people make what comes across as dubious decisions. But, within this world, they actually make perfect sense.”

Bamtefa said he sees the goodness in his character on the show.

“My character is the head of a very notorious gang, but he comes across as someone who is actually quite caring about others and his environment, and he has to balance it with living in this world, having a record and a lot of the labels that society puts on him … someone in his position is normally shown quite hard.”

This season, which was completed months prior to Renner’s accident, is likely not the last for “Mayor of Kingstown.” Dillon said he’s confident they’ll be back for a third, although there’s been no official announcement yet from Paramount.

“We’re moving full steam ahead,” Dillon added. “Taylor Sheridan called me last Sunday. I was putting out the trash and all of a sudden my phone rings as Taylor runs down all of season three and he goes, ‘So this is what’s gonna happen!’ And, you know, once you’re on Taylor time, that’s how that works.”(CNN) As Lisa Marie Presley's three daughters stand to inherit her estate and their grandmother is contesting the validity of her late daughter's will, some close to the family say the legal dispute now in a California court reflects a Presley family history of conflict over money.

Four days after Lisa Marie Presley's Graceland memorial service, Priscilla Presley filed a petition challenging a 2016 amendment in her daughter's will. The change removed Priscilla Presley and former business manager, Barry Siegel, as co-trustees and replaced them with her children, Riley and Benjamin Keough. Benjamin Keough later died in 2020.

Priscilla Presley's petition alleges that she did not receive notice of the amendment while her daughter was alive as was required by her Trust. The petition also notes that Priscilla's name is misspelled in the document, alleges the amendment was not witnessed or notarized and questions the authenticity of Lisa Marie's signature.

Keough has not yet responded to the petition. CNN has contacted her representatives for comment.

Two individuals who were longtime friends of Lisa Marie Presley spoke to CNN about the estate dispute. CNN is not naming the friends as they were not authorized to speak publicly on behalf of the family.

One friend alleged Priscilla Presley's petition is a "money grab."

"This is about Graceland and the memorabilia that Elvis left to Lisa Marie," the source said. "Lisa was the sole heir to his estate. She and her mother were estranged for the last several years. Lisa did not want her mother overseeing the estate. I believe Priscilla is after money and what's inside Graceland."

Priscilla and Lisa Marie Presley's relationship was strained over the years, the friends said, by their respective marriages and divorces, financial mismanagement, and personal trauma that has played out in the public eye as the former wife and the only child of the "King of Rock and Roll," respectively.

CNN made multiple attempts to reach Priscilla Presley's attorney for comment but has not heard back.

In a statement to CNN, sent Friday by a publicist after this story was first published, Priscilla Presley defended her efforts to protect her family's legacy.

"I loved Elvis very much as he loved me. Lisa is a result of our love. For anyone to think anything differently would be a travesty of the family legacy and would be disrespectful of what Elvis left behind in his life," Priscilla Presley said in part. "Please allow us the time we need to work together and sort this out. Please ignore 'the noise.' As I have always been there for Elvis' legacy, our family and the fans, I will continue to forge a pathway forward with respect, honesty, dignity, integrity and love."

Graceland

Priscilla and Elvis Presley divorced in 1973. Lisa Marie Presley was the sole inheritor of Graceland and her father's estate when he died in 1977. Priscilla Presley transformed the property into a lucrative tourist attraction and museum, held in a trust for Lisa Marie Presley until she turned 25.

In 2004, Lisa Marie sold 85% of Elvis Presley Enterprises' assets in a deal reportedly worth more than $100 million . She retained 15% ownership of Elvis Presley Enterprises, which manages operations for Graceland, its related properties and the Graceland Archives. Lisa Marie also maintained complete ownership of the Graceland mansion itself and her late father's personal items housed in its museum, including costumes and cars on display, according to the Graceland website.

A trust with the Graceland property and its contents will now pass on to her daughter, Riley Keough, an accomplished actress and model, along with her twin 14-year-old sisters, a representative for Graceland confirmed to CNN.

Keough has made several films and starred in the first season of the Starz anthology series, "The Girlfriend Experience."

"Riley is a sophisticated, 33-year-old woman who is more than capable of running the estate smoothly," the second close friend of Lisa Marie Presley told CNN.

In 2020, a Presley executive told Rolling Stone that the estate was worth between $400 and $500 million. Lisa Marie Presley annually earned seven figures from her interest in the estate, based on a court filing in her 2022 divorce.

So, now in the petition by Priscilla Presley challenging Lisa Marie's will, she has begun a legal fight against her granddaughter.

"This is about gaining control of what's left of Elvis' estate," one close friend alleged of Priscilla Presley's petition. "It's sad."

Elvis Presley's legacy

Brigitte Kruse, a memorabilia auctioneer, is listed as an attorney-in-fact for Priscilla on her petition.

Benny Roshan, Chair of the Trust and Probate Litigation Group at Greenberg Glusker with estate law expertise, told CNN an attorney-in-fact might be designated in situations where an individual is either "unable, unwilling, [or] unavailable" to act.

"This kind of raises the question of which of those three scenarios necessitates Priscilla filing a lawsuit [with an] attorney-in-fact," Roshan said.

Kruse and her husband started Kruse GWS Auctions Inc. in 2009, according to the company's website . They have collaborated with Priscilla Presley on Elvis memorabilia auctions in the past, though it's unclear what the terms of their financial partnership may be.

"My relationship with Ms. Presley was established years ago," Kruse said in a statement to CNN. "My entire adult career has been devoted to validating and protecting the legacy of Elvis Presley. It has been an honor to be one of the many conservators of the Presley family."

In August, CNN reported that Kruse arranged an auction of "lost" jewelry belonging to Elvis Presley.

"It was ... a collection that we (had) all heard about," Kruse told CNN in an email at the time. "It truly was a myth and a legend until we put our hands on it."

Priscilla Presley helped curate the sale and expressed in an interview with Reuters that she hoped her involvement would help combat the proliferation of fake Elvis memorabilia, adding: "I want to know for sure that that is going to go to someone who is going to care for it, love it."

"Elvis deserved for this collection to be found and displayed in order to preserve his legacy," Kruse said in a press release. "The fans also needed to know about this collection after 50 years, and all of the stories attached to each piece."

Dozens more Elvis Presley memorabilia items were listed as part of an "artifacts of Hollywood and music" auction that began in December 2022.

Kruse told Reuters that the items, such as an address book that belonged to the "It's Now or Never" singer, had increased in value since Lisa Marie Presley's death in an interview published last week

According to a press release, "The telephone address book is well documented by a personal recollection by Priscilla Presley adding to its unique provenance." It sold for $10,000, based on information on the auction site

Elvis Presley's life and career returned to the spotlight in a big way last summer with the Warner Bros. film "Elvis," starring actor Austin Butler in the title role. Priscilla and Lisa Marie Presley collaborated in support of the project. They appeared together at the Golden Globe Awards for the film in January, just days before Lisa Marie's death. (CNN and Warner Bros. are both part of Warner Bros. Discovery).

Away from the spotlight, however, one of Lisa Marie Presley's friends told CNN there was tension between the mother and daughter.

"They put on a united front for the film. It's a family business and they knew that if they began publicly battling it could hurt the bottom line," the friend said. "It was a complicated relationship."CNN —

“Shrinking” starts slowly, feeling like it’s going to be just another dour comedy as much about grief as laughs. Stick with it, though, and this Apple TV+ series from the team behind “Ted Lasso” really grows on you, with some very funny writing, appealing characters, and as a nifty bonus, Harrison Ford as an unexpectedly effective sitcom version of a cranky old man.

Jason Segel stars as Jimmy, a therapist wracked with grief and guilt over the death of his wife, which has turned him into a personal train wreck – outsourcing the upbringing of his teenage daughter (Lukita Maxwell) to his neighbor (Christa Miller) – and risks spilling over into his professional life.

“It’s just awful here without her,” he mutters early on, giving a sense of how emotional wounded he is.

Specifically, Jimmy experiences “compassion fatigue,” and begins telling his patients exactly what he thinks, even if that means prodding them to change their lives in a very un-therapist like way – tiptoeing (and occasionally leaping) over ethical boundaries. He even takes in a young veteran with anger issues (Luke Tennie), violating all those rules about maintaining professional distance.

All of this is unsettling to Jimmy’s two colleagues, Gaby (Jessica Williams) and Paul (Ford, wearing a lot hats right now, with two streaming series, including “1923”), the former dealing with a failing marriage, the latter in the early stages of Parkinson’s disease.

Everyone here, in other words, has issues, and Jimmy’s – which is crippling at first – isn’t particularly original, inasmuch as Ricky Gervais explored very similar themes as a widowed guy in the melancholy “After Life.”

What makes “Shrinking” tolerable at first, and quite good as it progresses, is that everyone here is also funny, milking laughs out of amusing situations and sharp dialogue, from an uncomfortable encounter at a soccer game to a planned wedding proposal that doesn’t exactly go as planned.

Created by Segel and the “Lasso” tandem of Bill Lawrence (who is married to Miller) and Brett Goldstein, “Shrinking” also keeps putting together different characters in sweetly unexpected ways, from Paul quietly counseling Jimmy’s daughter to Gaby and Liz starting at odds and gradually finding common ground.

The show thus keeps revealing layers and dimensions to the characters, who seem to be having a ball playing off each other. That’s perhaps especially true of Ford, who real vulnerability beneath the gruff exterior, acting as a de facto father to Jimmy while grappling with greater fragility thanks to his condition.

In a way, the series has a good deal in common with “Ted Lasso,” in the sense that it succeeds not because of its premise – which sounds completely ordinary and familiar – but in spite of it. “Shrinking” isn’t a big idea, but with a big heart and genuine laughs, it, too, achieves its goal.

“Shrinking” premieres January 27 on Apple TV+. (Disclosure: Lowry’s wife works for a unit of Apple.)CNN —

For some people, relaxation looks like settling down with a nice glass of wine and the most graphic, disturbing tale of murder imaginable.

True crime stories have always appealed to our baser natures. Now, the genre is practically a lifestyle, with endless docuseries, podcasts and investigations to binge and discuss over TikTok comments or the brunch table. An entire genre of lifestyle-slash-true-crime videos commands hundreds of thousands of followers on YouTube, where influencers do their makeup while casually discussing all manner of atrocities.

It’s absurd, in a way, how something so dark has found such a hallowed place in the pantheon of pop culture. “Saturday Night Live” produced its own classic take on “murder shows,” and TikTok is full of jokes about people appearing to peacefully go about their lives while the voice in their headphones drones on about cut-off arms and legs. True crime releases show no signs of slowing down, with recent streaming titles including “The Hatchet Wielding Hitchhiker” (Netflix) and “Death in the Dorms” (Hulu).

However, the boom in sordid tales of human woe has led some true crime enthusiasts to consider the ethical ramifications of their passion. After all, true crime is called “true” for a reason. At the heart of every new Netflix special or headline-making investigation is a victim and a family, to say nothing of the countless people whose involvement in these tragedies amounts to far more than entertainment. Is there an ethical way to be a true crime fan? And if there is, what’s acceptable and what’s not?

One fan draws the line

Bobbi Miller, an entertainment expert and host of the entertainment podcast “The Afternoon Special,” has been leading conversations about ethical true crime consumption for years. She says she felt uncomfortable watching “Dahmer,” the first installment of a Netflix true crime anthology series that focused on the notorious serial killer.

She felt even more uncomfortable watching the series explode in popularity despite widespread concerns among true crime watchers that the slickly produced series glamorized Jeffrey Dahmer and unfolded counter to the wishes of some of his victims’ families. Evan Peters, who played the titular role, even won a Golden Globe for his portrayal, inviting further outcry from people affected by Dahmer’s very real crimes.

“I do think true crime is unethical,” she tells CNN. “It doesn’t mean it’s something that shouldn’t exist. The line in the sand, for me, is whether a piece of media takes a fiction or non-fiction approach, in terms of sensationalizing the narrative or trying create appeal around a criminal.”

While some documentaries and other media contain nuance and respect that sets them apart from more sordid offerings, Miller says she still encourages people to not let their enjoyment of true crime cross the line into obsession. Ethical true crime stories, she says, are the ones that focus on victims and don’t center the criminal as some cult of personality or mysterious mind to untangle.

“When you walk away from a true crime story, it should be with a certain amount of reverence for the victim,” she says.

Entertainment or reality?

The viewing public has always had a strong interest in so-called “trials of the century,” whether they crowded around a TV during the OJ Simpson trial in the 1990s or snatched up newspapers to keep track of the crimes of Lizzie Borden in the 1800s. However, the popularity of 2014’s “Serial” podcast launched true crime into a new era of ubiquity. Over the next decade, it became one of the most popular genres across multiple forms of media. In 2020, true crime was the third most popular podcast genre across all major podcast platforms, with major shows like “My Favorite Murder” and “Crime Junkie” clocking in among the top 10 most listened-to offerings for the year.

Women are more likely to be true crime fans than men, and that was true even before the current “Serial”-led era. Now, women are much more likely to follow true crime stories on social media – a major meeting place for people to either consume so-called murder shows together or comment on current cases.

This gendered appeal is evident in all the ways true crime bleeds into other areas of pop culture: Many popular true crime influencers on YouTube are young women. Before fans dig in to their latest documentary, an endless supply of murder-themed merch on Etsy assures they can snuggle up with a “This is my true crime watching blanket” throw, light a Jeffrey Dahmer-themed candle or pour some tea in a mug that reads, “Roses are red, violets are blue. I’ve watched enough crime shows. They’ll never find you.”

Miller also notes that true crime fans communicate and trade information in ways that are very similar to other entertainment fandoms.

“The difference is, ‘Star Wars’ and Marvel fandoms treat their fiction as if it’s real, where true crime fandoms treat something very real as fiction,” she says.

Why, exactly, true crime is so appealing is its own unsolved mystery.

“I definitely think that part of the reason women are drawn to true crime is that there is a level of relatability for women to the victims in these stories,” says Brigham Young University communications professor Kevin John. “And we often project ourselves onto the media we consume.”

This blurred line can cause real damage when true crime fans look past sordid docuseries and addicting podcasts to find entertainment in real-life cases that have yet to fully bear out. The murder of four University of Idaho students in late 2022 is a tragic example of what happens when crimes are treated as mysteries to be solved. The investigation went on for weeks before police arrested suspect Bryan Kohberger, prompting amateur detectives to post various theories, including unfounded accusations against those they suspected, online.

True crime content has gotten a huge boost from TikTok and YouTube, where cases new and old can be broken down into a few short, tantalizing segments or spun together for hour-plus deep dives that lock in fascinated viewers. These platforms are also where a lot of true crime influencers and devotees are trying to work through the ethical quandaries of the genre.

Several meaningful conversations have been started by family members or loved ones of victims who have seen their pain turned into entertainment – sometimes against their will.

Mariah Day’s mother, Betsy Faria, was murdered in 2011, and her case attracted breathless media coverage, including a spot on Dateline. In 2022, her story was part of a drama miniseries called “The Thing About Pam,” starring Renee Zellwegger as the titular Pam Hupp, who was charged with Faria’s murder in 2021.

Day uses her TikTok account to advocate for victim awareness, and give people a glimpse of what it’s like on the other side of the true crime love affair.

“My trauma is not your entertainment,” she says in one video. “Awareness is a whole different story. Let’s talk about it.”

True crime fans who are trying to be responsible about their interests sometimes call for others to avoid certain media, either because of the narrative or because it was created without the consent of those affected.

Even Dr. Phil – the Dr. Phil, who comments on criminal cases as part of his brand – has shared tips on how to responsibly consume true crime content.

While he says curiosity for the dark side of human nature is normal, “don’t fall for some romanticized version. Focus on the facts. There’s no soundtrack in life. Only pain.” He also suggests doing something positive for the families of victims, learning about crime legislation, or using true crime as a teaching moment to help others stay alert.

This deconstruction, this interrogation of what true crime entertainment provides and who it endangers, doesn’t necessarily run counter to enjoyment of the genre, as many debates about true crime ethics begin within the community itself.

Miller points out that there are larger social issues at play. “It’s really fascinating to observe who interacts with true crime. It’s a lot of White women,” she says. “That says a lot when you think about the types of cases that get this kind of coverage, and the types of cases that get attention in the US judicial system.”

The public tendency to focus on young, White female victims is an enduring complication of true crime, stretching back through the cases of JonBenét Ramsey, Madeleine McCann and Natalee Holloway to more recently, the murder of Gabby Petito. This “missing White woman syndrome,” as it’s colloquially called, is another facet that proponents of ethical true crime seek to confront.

Jordan Preston’s sister, Brooke Preston, was stabbed to death by her roommate in 2017. Preston attracted a social media following after heavily criticizing the 2021 documentary “Dead Asleep,” which profiles her sister’s killer and his defense that he committed the murder while sleepwalking.

When one TikTok commenter asked her how there would be any documentaries at all if families always had a say, Preston replied that kind of attention could actually go toward pursuing justice for others.

“Can someone please explain why your entertainment is so much more important than … what a victim’s family wants?” she said in response. “There are so many crimes committed (where) victims don’t get the type of recognition and attention and media coverage they literally need to get solved. For some reason, (other) victims’ families are getting re-victimized, and put through trauma they need to deal with all over again.”

Ethical true crime, then, could be the kind that puts victims and their loved ones first, or explores how and which cases get solved and how the legal system bears out. It could be the kind, as victim advocates suggest, that focuses on cases of missing and exploited Indigenous people and people of color. Mindful true crime fans want to be kept up at night by the answers they seek – not by the harm the genre may cause others.CNN —

Angela Bassett had to grapple with loss and grief during her reign as Queen Ramonda in Marvel’s “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.”

“This movie was about grief and loss, family, a remembrance, a legacy and moving on,” Bassett told Deadline in an interview published this week. “That’s something that’s so very human.”

Her loss was that of the 2018 “Black Panther” film’s star Chadwick Boseman, who played King T’Challa. Boseman died in August 2020 after a battle with colon cancer at age 43.

Yet, the two-time Oscar nominee managed to find light amid the darkness once “Wakanda Forever” came out.

“To actually connect with audience members who have gone through some of this, and it being a source of comfort and conversation for them and their families, that really is quite an honor that you’re not expecting,” Bassett said.

She added that it’s an “honor” when entertainment has a real impact on the lives of viewers.

“Wakanda Forever” honored Boseman’s King T’Challa with a farewell that felt fitting for not just the character, but for the beloved actor, too.

“It’s just ever hopeful,” Bassett said of the film. “I think we definitely tried to impart the feeling of, ‘A good morning comes after a long, dark night.’”

Bassett made history when she was nominated for best supporting actress for her role in “Wakanda Forever,” becoming the first actor to earn an Oscar nod for a Marvel film.

While that historic marker will live on in real life, Bassett’s Queen Ramonda saw her final end in the movie – something the actor admitted that she was “shocked” and “surprised” to learn at first. Bassett said she even pushed back against it to the film’s director Ryan Coogler.

“I love being queen,” Bassett said, adding that she’s “ultimately there to serve the vision of the filmmaker” and that she “got over it” quickly.

It should be noted, though, that in the fantastical Marvel universe a character’s on-screen death doesn’t always mean an absolute end.

Bassett hinted toward that theory applying to Queen Ramonda, saying, “I think anything is possible.”

In addition to Bassett’s historic Oscar nomination, she also made history in January at the Golden Globes, becoming the first performer to win a Globe in an acting category for their role in a Marvel film.CNN —

The “Rocky” sequels aren’t exactly known for their nuanced opponents, so give “Creed III” credit for trying to flesh out its antagonist, played by Jonathan Majors. But bulking up the back story slows the pacing, in a movie that finally delivers the goods but whose broader ambitions under director/star Michael B. Jordan get boxed in by its ring-shaped formula.

If only the script and story were in the same kind of fighting shape as its leads. Grounding the narrative in Adonis Creed’s past does provide a weightier foundation, but the tradeoff is an element of sluggishness in a movie that, despite its impressive cast, never feels particularly light on its toes.

A 20-year-old flashback introduces the young Adonis at a pivotal moment with his friend Damian (Majors when he grows up), a promising Golden Gloves boxer. Something happens that sends the latter to jail, and after his release 18 years later he’s eager to make up for lost time, even though he’s past what would normally be considered any fighter’s prime.

Adonis, meanwhile, is happily retired from the ring, helping develop boxers (including the reigning heavyweight champ) and orchestrate fights, while happily raising his young daughter (Mila Davis-Kent) with his wife Bianca (Tessa Thompson). Still, he carries guilt over what transpired with Damian, resisting Bianca’s pleas to open up about their history and what’s gnawing at him.

Hoping to make amends, Adonis throws Damian work as a sparring partner for the champ, though his old friend still hungers for the title shot he was denied. When circumstances derail a planned championship bout an opportunity presents itself, with the prospect of giving an unknown his chance drawing comparisons to the late Apollo Creed’s long-ago stunt with that Rocky guy.

Adonis presses ahead, ignoring the objections of his former trainer and now partner, played by Wood Harris. (Sylvester Stallone, for the first time, has opted to sit this one out, although he is credited among the producers.)

“I still got gas in the tank,” Damian insists in response to Adonis’ initial skepticism, and Majors – the highlight of the recent “Ant-Man” sequel – invests the character with a quiet sense of menace and determination that does feel combustible.

While that construction makes a good deal of sense (“Creed” director Ryan Coogler shares story credit with his brother, Keenan Coogler, and Zach Baylin), there’s a flatness to the middle rounds – including the time devoted to Adonis’ domestic bliss – before getting down to business.

The same goes for the boxing sequences, which stumble a bit when Jordan seeks to expand the template by incorporating slow motion and a moment when the world essentially melts away, leaving only the fighters to duke it out in an empty void – an interesting device that ultimately doesn’t quite work.

Those deductions aside, the Jordan-Majors dynamic (as it happens, a faceoff of two topnotch Marvel villains) imbues the movie with heavyweight talent in more ways than one. The challenge is that the durability of the “Rocky” franchise from which “Creed” has cleverly drawn in the earlier films makes it as difficult to mess up its simplest charms as it is to enhance or deviate from them.

“Creed III” offers enough appealing elements, old and new, to finally come out ahead on points. Yet those strengths are balanced by shortcomings that make that judgment something seldom seen in this winner-take-all movie world of boxing – namely, a split decision.

Harrison Ford has said he intends to hang up his whip as Indiana Jones after the new film hits theaters, but famed film composer John Williams isn’t so sure “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” will be his own last film adventure.

In an interview with CNN’s Chris Wallace for a new episode of “Who’s Talking to Chris Wallace?” the 91-year-old Oscar winner, a frequent collaborator of director Steven Spielberg, said while it is possible that the forthcoming fifth installment of the Indiana Jones franchise could be the final film on which he acts as composer, he’s leaving the door open.

“I’m not anxious to go into another film. But…Steven is a hard man to say no to,” he said. “If he should turn around tomorrow with another ‘Schindler’s List,’ you probably have to fight me to keep me away from it.”

Williams and Spielberg first worked together on the 1974 film, “The Sugarland Express.”

Williams went on to compose a litany of iconic scores for the director, including the ones for “Jaws,” “E.T. The Extra Terrestrial” and “Jurassic Park.” He also composed the score for Spielberg’s Oscar-nominated “The Fabelmans,” which was inspired by the director’s life.

Williams said above all, he’s “grateful to be working in music.” He recently finished composing a violin concerto for German violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter and, he said, “not doing a film has made that possible.”

“There’s one thing I would say about working in film, a film like Indiana Jones can take six months,” he said. “Six months when you’re 91 is a long time. So, you’re asking somebody to make a commitment from what a large percentage of the time, the earthly time you may have left.”

Luckily, Williams said, he’s feeling “healthy” and, in fact, called this time in his life a special one.

“I like to think that…from 80 to 90 is the best decade of a woman’s or a man’s life. For the reason that from 80 to 90, you lose a little something. You don’t walk quite as fast, you don’t hit a golf ball quite as far. But there are enormous compensations,” he said. “You see the great beauty around us. The music, it means so much more to me every passing day.”

The trailer for Disney’s “Peter Pan & Wendy” – based on the Mouse House’s 1953 animated classic “Peter Pan” – dropped on Tuesday, and it certainly presents a movie that looks far more inclusive than past retellings of the original J.M. Barrie tale.

“But you’re not all boys,” Ever Anderson’s Wendy Darling says to a group of kids in Neverland who tell her they’re the “Lost Boys” in the clip.

Those kids are, in fact, not all boys. Two girls then appear on screen to respond to Wendy’s observation with a simple and spirited, “So!?”

“Blackish” star Yara Shahidi is also seen in the trailer as Tinker Bell, Peter’s fairy friend who accompanies him and the Darlings through Neverland. Shahidi is the first Black woman to portray the tiny fairy on screen.

The movie also stars Alexander Molony in his feature film debut as Peter Pan, and Jude Law as a very creepy-looking Captain Hook, who is seen in the trailer sporting his signature hook, red coat and twisted mustache as he asks Wendy, “Where is Peter Pan?”

The trailer shows all of the classic figures from the ’53 film, including the Darlings’ beloved dog Nana and a faithful representation of John Darling (Joshua Pickering) in his top hat and rounded spectacles.

An aerial view of the mermaids shimmering and splashing in the sea beneath Wendy and her brothers, who are soaring the skies above, is shown in the trailer. And Tiger Lily, played by Alyssa Wapanatâhk, is seen telling Wendy, “Hold the past in your heart, but where you go from here is up to you.”

From the 1991 cult classic “Hook” starring Robin Williams, Dustin Hoffman and Julia Roberts to NBC’s 2014 “Peter Pan Live” telecast starring Allison Williams and the 2015 “Pan” film, Peter Pan and Wendy’s adventure is a story that’s been previously visualized on screen in countless ways.

The new “Peter Pan & Wendy” presents an inclusive version of the classic tale, one that blends Pan’s fantasy world into a landscape for today.

It’s already been a huge year for Rihanna. Earlier this month, the nine-time Grammy-winner announced she’s expecting another child with rapper A$AP Rocky following the Super Bowl, where she performed live for the first time in seven years.

“Wakanda Forever” is nominated for five Oscars this season and made history with its star Angela Bassett earning the first-ever acting nomination for a Marvel film. Bassett earned one previous acting nomination for her portrayal of Tina Turner in 1993’s Turner biopic “What’s Love Got to Do With It?”

Halle Bailey can’t wait for audiences to see the new live-action “The Little Mermaid” and is unfazed by naysayers.

In a new interview with The Face published on Thursday, the singer and actor said that the backlash that arose when news broke of her being cast as mermaid Ariel – and again when the first glimpse of her in the role was revealed last fall – was not surprising.

“As a Black person, you just expect it and it’s not really a shock anymore,” the Grammy nominee said.

“People don’t understand that when you’re Black there’s this whole other community,” she shared. “It’s so important for us to see ourselves.”

To that point, Bailey also mentioned that after the teaser dropped, when parents started sharing videos of their Black daughters marveling at Bailey as Ariel, she stared at them “in disbelief.”

​”It makes me feel more grateful for where I am,” she said.

The rising star also credited the “Little Mermaid” filmmakers with allowing her authentic identity to be a part of this new iteration of the aquatic Disney princess, specifically with regard to her hair.

​”As a Black woman, hair is spiritual, especially locs,” Bailey said, also mentioning that a significant portion of prep time on set was devoted to analyzing how her hair moved in water.

“It was really cool for them to make Ariel a version of me with my locs,” she added.

“The Little Mermaid,” based on the 1989 animated classic, also stars Melissa McCarthy as sea witch Ursula. It is slated for release on May 26.CNN —

It is one of the most beloved movie series of all time, but Peter Jackson’s “The Lord of the Rings” trilogy only scratched the surface of the rich world of Middle-earth created by J.R.R. Tolkien.

And “multiple” new movies set in Middle-earth are in the works, Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav announced on Thursday in an earnings call, after studio heads Mike De Luca and Pam Abdy signed a deal with Freemode, a division of Swedish entertainment company Embracer Group, which acquired the movie rights to Tolkien’s work in August last year. (Warner Bros. Discovery is the parent company of CNN.)

Warner Bros. will produce the movies together with sister company New Line Cinema and Freemode, “expanding upon the much-loved world and characters of Middle-earth,” a statement released by Embracer read.

Currently, New Line and Warner Bros. Animation are in production on an anime movie “The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim,” a story set 183 years before the events of “The Lord of the Rings,” recounting the fate of Helm Hammerhand, a King of Rohan.

Neither the cost of the deal nor the creative team were revealed, although Jackson and his collaborators Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens told CNN in a statement that Warner Bros. and Embracer have kept them “in the loop” and that they “look forward to speaking with them further to hear their vision for the franchise moving forward.”

Jackson’s original trilogy, released between 2001 and 2003, was widely acclaimed, collecting 17 Academy Awards and generating almost $3 billion at the box office.

Other adaptations of Tolkien’s books have since been produced for the big and small screens.

Jackson’s “The Hobbit” movie trilogy also generated almost $3 billion in global receipts, while Amazon, which owns the TV rights to “The Lord of the Rings,” released its first season of “The Rings of Power” in 2022.

“Twenty years ago, New Line took an unprecedented leap of faith to realize the incredible stories, characters and world of ‘The Lord of the Rings’ on the big screen,” De Luca and Abdy said in a statement.

“But for all the scope and detail lovingly packed into the two trilogies, the vast, complex and dazzling universe dreamed up by J.R.R. Tolkien remains largely unexplored on film. The opportunity to invite fans deeper into the cinematic world of Middle-earth is an honor,” they added.(CNN) After winning a Grammy Award, Viola Davis has officially completed the holy grail of entertainment awards.

Davis' Sunday win for the audiobook of her memoir "Finding Me" completes her EGOT collection. She previously won an Emmy for her role in "How to Get Away with Murder," an Oscar for "Fences," and two Tony awards for "King Hedley III" and "Fences."

In her acceptance speech, the multi-hyphenate performer paid tribute to her younger self.

"I wrote this book to honor the 6-year-old Viola," she said. "To honor her life, her joy, her trauma, everything. And, it has just been such a journey -- I just EGOT!"
