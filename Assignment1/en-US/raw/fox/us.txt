The duo, who have a 200,000-strong following on their TikTok page, @thenakedbuilders, met Murdaugh and Doughty while vacationing to Nassau and became long-distance friends.

They shared video earlier this week of the boozy encounter – with an under-21 Murdaugh standing behind the bar, Doughty drinking at his side and the hit bar anthem "Shots" blaring in the background.

Murdaugh's father Alex shot him to death alongside his mother, Maggie, at a family property on June 7, 2021 – and the Brits had no idea until they saw their friend's face pop up on TV.

While Pink had been one of the last people to speak with Murdaugh – via text just weeks before the murder, he said he had no idea about the February 2019 boat crash that killed Mallory Beach, and injured several others, including their Bahamas pal Doughty.

At the time of his death, Murdaugh was awaiting trial on felony drunken driving charges for the wreck.

"That was when I tagged him and Morgan, and then I received that message from him," he said. "Obviously, we didn't know anything had happened or anything like that."

Murdaugh reached out via Instagram to ask Burton to take the video down, writing, "Me and that girl are no longer dating and are not supposed to have any contact."

The British pals did not know about the crash at the time, they said, and they did not push the issue either, assuming Murdaugh was just going through a breakup and did not want to talk about it.

Doughty did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital.

Pink and Burton had gone to Nassau, Bahamas, to visit a friend who was working on the Baha Mar resort, a towering luxury hotel visible at sea – from the opposite side of the island.

Their host had to work one day and dropped them off near the port to bar hop. They found a hot spot called Senor Frogs, went inside, and it began to fill up.

Murdaugh approached them first, and despite an age difference of more than a decade, they hit it off. They added they never met Murdaugh's drunken alter ego, "Timmy," that night during the booze-fueled encounter.

"He just seemed like a confident young man that wanted to have fun and that come across in the conversations that we had, you know, throughout the years as well," Pink said.

At one point, without asking anyone for permission, he went behind the bar. That was when they took the video.

"We just sort of connected straight from the off and just kept in touch," Burton said, usually through Snapchat or Instagram.

It was also the first time they learned of the deaths of Stephen Smith, who went to high school with Paul's older brother Buster, as well and the Murdaugh family housekeeper Gloria Satterfield.

The story left them "dumbfounded" and "utterly shocked," Pink said. It also cast Murdaugh in a new light – one they said they hadn't seen before.

"He's made to look bad in the documentary," Burton said. "From when we met him, he didn't come across like that at all."

James Brenner, 59, shot a man at a Maryland campground in the 1980s over a work dispute, court records show, and has been in custody since July after police found the felon unlawfully in possession of multiple firearms following the disappearance of Rounds, who was 19 when he was last seen and would be 20 today.

Box Elder County authorities announced the murder charge last week after they said they had recovered Rounds' phone – and an incriminating video on it allegedly showing Brenner wearing bloody clothes and cleaning a gun.

Deputies found the clothes – and Rounds' DNA on them, according to authorities.

Brenner was squatting on land next to Rounds' property and where authorities found the missing man's boots and farm truck, according to court documents. They found blood on one of the boots – as well as Brenner's DNA, according to the criminal complaint.

Deputies first identified him as a suspect over the summer after his arrest on firearms charges. Now he faces a charge of aggravated murder, as well as abuse or desecration of a body, and is accused of concealing Rounds' remains.

Candice Cooley, Rounds’ mother, told Fox News Digital at the time that Brenner was an "acquaintance" of her son, disputing the description in court filings, which referred to him as a "family friend."

UTAH TEENAGE FARMER MISSING MORE THAN 2 WEEKS AS MOM FEARS FOUL PLAY

"I'm keeping it together as best I can," she said at the time.

Brenner's past criminal history includes malicious wounding, malicious shooting and three prior convictions for being a felon in possession of a firearm, court records show.

"The defendant has no work history and is currently unemployed and has no verifiable residence," court documents state. "The defendant was trespassing and squatting on property."

As part of their search for Rounds , investigators served several search warrants. Two of them led to federal cases against men who had interacted with Rounds before his disappearance – Brenner and Chase Venstra.

When police announced the murder charge against Brenner last week, they also ruled out the potential involvement of Venstra or any other suspects in Rounds' disappearance.

The evidence supports that James Brenner is the only suspect. — Chief Deputy Cade Palmer/Box Elder County Sheriff’s Office

According to a neighbor identified in court documents as DH, at some point after Rounds’ disappearance, Brenner asked him to conceal three black powder guns and a .22-caliber rifle without a serial number. After being contacted by the FBI, DH gave the weapons to authorities. Citing past felony convictions , they charged Brenner with being a felon in possession of a firearm.

"When Dylan Rounds was not located early on in the search effort, the investigation focused on the possibility of Dylan being the victim of a crime," Palmer told Fox News Digital at the time.

An Idaho native, Rounds went out on his own as a teenager to build up his own farm in Utah , according to Cooley. He had a passion for the work and spent no time playing video games or on social media like others his age, she said, and he did not use drugs.

She suspected foul play almost immediately when family members lost contact with him.

Palmer had previously issued a blunt warning to anyone who may have been involved in Rounds’ disappearance .

"If somebody's laying low that was involved in this or knows something, and they think they lay low long enough we're just going to go away, that's not going to happen," he told Fox News Digital. "We're going to keep at this until we get answers."

The search for Rounds' remains is ongoing in a rural area dotted with abandoned mines and cave systems.

A South Carolina detective who responded to the scene of the Murdaugh double murders on the evening of June 7, 2021, addressed lingering questions about details of the scene and about Alex Murdaugh following her testimony at Murdaugh's trial in January.

A Colleton County jury convicted the disgraced 54-year-old lawyer on March 3 for fatally shooting his wife, Maggie Murdaugh, and younger son, Paul Murdaugh, multiple times on his hunting estate in Islandton. He was sentenced to life in prison.

Colleton County Sheriff's Office Det. Laura Rutland was one of the first few investigators to interview Murdaugh at the crime scene and noticed that he was wearing a clean, white t-shirt and cargo shorts, even though the former lawyer told investigators that he had tried to take Paul's pulse and turn his body over, which struck her as odd.

"Paul and Maggie were shot multiple times. Paul was shot by a shotgun, which caused catastrophic damage to the top of his head. In addition to the biological matter around his body, there was also a lot of water," Rutland, the state's first witness in the Murdaugh trial, told Fox News Digital. "And [the jury was] able to see that on Sergeant Green's body cam. It was just so odd that even Alex's shoes were as clean as they were, including the soles of the shoes."

Rutland also clarified a question Murdaugh's defense asked her in court about hair found in Maggie's hand after she was shot to death.

"I just wanted to clarify that when she had suffered her injuries, and the bullet exited the back of her head, it created a large hole, which displaced that part of her skull, including her scalp and her hair," the detective explained. "So, all around her body, there were small clumps of the back of her hair in the grass around her body. Some had fallen near her hands and her arms. And when we removed her body, some of the hair that was on her fingers. It was just a few strands went with her."

DEATH OF MURDAUGH BOAT CRASH VICTIM MALLORY BEACH IN SPOTLIGHT AT DOUBLE-MURDER TRIAL

Rutland was assigned to work the case at the time, because she was not familiar with the Murdaugh family and their family's legal legacy in the South Carolina Lowcountry.

"I got there and was kind of surprised by how many law enforcement [vehicles] there were. And I was like, ‘Okay, this must not be a normal double homicide. Something's going on,'" Rutland, the state's first witness, told Fox News Digital. "They asked me if I knew the Murdaugh family, and I didn't, so I got chosen to work with [South Carolina Law Enforcement Division Agent] David Owen. ... I went in there with the thought to just handle it like every other case."

ALEX MURDAUGH'S SUICIDE-FOR-HIRE HITMAN CURTIS ‘EDDIE’ SMITH COULD BE KEY PLAYER IN NEXT TRIAL

Rewatching video of her interview with Murdaugh, Rutland said it seemed like he was "trying to... make himself cry" when recounting what he had witnessed at the dog kennels that evening.

Murdaugh initially told investigators he hadn't been to the dog kennels at all that night. He said he had taken at nap at the house on the hunting property and then driven to see his sick mother before returning to find Maggie and Paul dead near the kennels. A video that Paul snapped on his phone later revealed Murdaugh's voice at the dog kennels just before the murders took place.

After the guilty verdict, jurors exiting the courthouse thanked Rutland and Colleton County Cpt. Jason Chapman for their work, Rutland said.

"I'm very proud of the jury that they were able to follow such a complicated case and understand all the facts and evidence that we brought to them the night of the conviction," she said. "It was kind of crazy in the courthouse afterwards with the media and everybody. We were trying to get everyone out of the courthouse safely. My captain and I just happened to come out of a side door where the jury was being escorted... and they wanted to shake our hands. I'll never forget that moment. I was very impressed with the jury and appreciative of their service to Colleton County."

Inside the home, they also found the bodies of a woman and the suspect.

"Khodakaramrezaei had reportedly listened to the female victim’s podcasts and began communicating with her," police said in a statement. "The victim and suspect became friends, but when things escalated, she filed a no-contact order against him."

Court records show that Sadeghi and Naseri's lawyer told a judge last week he wasn't sure whether Khodakaramrezaei owned weapons but believed he might.

The court granted a temporary order of protection and an order for Khodakaramrezaei to surrender his weapons.

The couple's attorney did not immediately return a call seeking comment.

Redmond Police say detectives were already familiar with the victim due to the ongoing stalking investigation.

"The suspect is in custody and is in fact, wounded," Detroit Police Chief White said. "It appears that through the exchange of gunfire earlier, he was struck. He is now in custody without further incident."

Firefighter Jason Arno "was a socialite, master chef, gambler, magician, server and firefighter," his brother Delton Arno told mourners at St. Joseph Cathedral in Buffalo. "Every new day made memories for a hundred lifetimes."

Delton Arno said he and his brother were together "through summer bikes, boats, trampolines laser tag, hikes on islands, being stranded in the airport, drinks in Mexico, funerals," adding, "More than anything I am so thankful."

BUFFALO FIREFIGHTER KILLED IN DOWNTOWN BLAZE IDENTIFIED

Jason Arno, 37, was battling a blaze in a vacant commercial building on March 1 when an explosive backdraft sent flames shooting through the windows and knocked firefighters outside to the sidewalk.

Arno issued a mayday call from inside the building, then went silent. His body was found hours later.

The cause of the fire is under investigation.

A light snow fell Friday as thousands of firefighters from around the country gathered outside the cathedral.

Inside, mourners remembered Arno as a Buffalo native who loved his family and his city.

"He made it his mission to make our city a better and safer place for everyone," Mayor Byron Brown said.

Brown said that after graduating from an all-boys Roman Catholic high school in Buffalo, Arno, who was known as Jay, enrolled in culinary school at a local community college and was chosen for an internship at a top restaurant in Italy.

Arno worked at restaurants and bars around Buffalo, Brown said, and then saw his life change in 2019 when he and wife Sarah-Elizabeth welcomed their baby daughter Olivia.

Arno's death was the first line-of-duty firefighter death in Buffalo, a city of 276,000 in western New York, since two firefighters fell through the floor of a burning building and died in August 2009.Dylan Rounds, a teen farmer from Idaho who set out on his own in Utah and was expecting his first harvest when he vanished last year, remains unaccounted for one week after police charged his ex-con neighbor with his murder.

James Brenner, 59, shot a man at a Maryland campground in the 1980s over a work dispute, court records show, and has been in custody since July after police found the felon unlawfully in possession of multiple firearms following the disappearance of Rounds, who was 19 when he was last seen and would be 20 today.

Box Elder County authorities announced the murder charge last week after they said they had recovered Rounds' phone – and an incriminating video on it allegedly showing Brenner wearing bloody clothes and cleaning a gun.

Deputies found the clothes – and Rounds' DNA on them, according to authorities.

MISSING DYLAN ROUNDS: UTAH DEPUTIES NAME SQUATTER NEIGHBOR AS SUSPECT IN DISAPPEARANCE OF 19-YEAR-OLD FARMER

Brenner was squatting on land next to Rounds' property and where authorities found the missing man's boots and farm truck, according to court documents. They found blood on one of the boots – as well as Brenner's DNA, according to the criminal complaint.

Deputies first identified him as a suspect over the summer after his arrest on firearms charges. Now he faces a charge of aggravated murder, as well as abuse or desecration of a body, and is accused of concealing Rounds' remains.

Candice Cooley, Rounds’ mother, told Fox News Digital at the time that Brenner was an "acquaintance" of her son, disputing the description in court filings, which referred to him as a "family friend."

UTAH TEENAGE FARMER MISSING MORE THAN 2 WEEKS AS MOM FEARS FOUL PLAY

"I'm keeping it together as best I can," she said at the time.

Brenner's past criminal history includes malicious wounding, malicious shooting and three prior convictions for being a felon in possession of a firearm, court records show.

"The defendant has no work history and is currently unemployed and has no verifiable residence," court documents state. "The defendant was trespassing and squatting on property."

As part of their search for Rounds , investigators served several search warrants. Two of them led to federal cases against men who had interacted with Rounds before his disappearance – Brenner and Chase Venstra.

When police announced the murder charge against Brenner last week, they also ruled out the potential involvement of Venstra or any other suspects in Rounds' disappearance.

The evidence supports that James Brenner is the only suspect. — Chief Deputy Cade Palmer/Box Elder County Sheriff’s Office

According to a neighbor identified in court documents as DH, at some point after Rounds’ disappearance, Brenner asked him to conceal three black powder guns and a .22-caliber rifle without a serial number. After being contacted by the FBI, DH gave the weapons to authorities. Citing past felony convictions , they charged Brenner with being a felon in possession of a firearm.

"When Dylan Rounds was not located early on in the search effort, the investigation focused on the possibility of Dylan being the victim of a crime," Palmer told Fox News Digital at the time.

An Idaho native, Rounds went out on his own as a teenager to build up his own farm in Utah , according to Cooley. He had a passion for the work and spent no time playing video games or on social media like others his age, she said, and he did not use drugs.

She suspected foul play almost immediately when family members lost contact with him.

Palmer had previously issued a blunt warning to anyone who may have been involved in Rounds’ disappearance .

"If somebody's laying low that was involved in this or knows something, and they think they lay low long enough we're just going to go away, that's not going to happen," he told Fox News Digital. "We're going to keep at this until we get answers."

The search for Rounds' remains is ongoing in a rural area dotted with abandoned mines and cave systems.

The duo, who have a 200,000-strong following on their TikTok page, @thenakedbuilders, met Murdaugh and Doughty while vacationing to Nassau and became long-distance friends.

They shared video earlier this week of the boozy encounter – with an under-21 Murdaugh standing behind the bar, Doughty drinking at his side and the hit bar anthem "Shots" blaring in the background.

Murdaugh's father Alex shot him to death alongside his mother, Maggie, at a family property on June 7, 2021 – and the Brits had no idea until they saw their friend's face pop up on TV.

Alex Murdaugh, who was convicted last week of the murders of Paul and Maggie and sentenced to life in prison, has already filed an appeal.

Fox News' Haley Chi-Sing contributed to this report.WARNING: ARTICLE CONTAINS GRAPHIC CONTENT

A South Carolina detective who responded to the scene of the Murdaugh double murders on the evening of June 7, 2021, addressed lingering questions about details of the scene and about Alex Murdaugh following her testimony at Murdaugh's trial in January.

A Colleton County jury convicted the disgraced 54-year-old lawyer on March 3 for fatally shooting his wife, Maggie Murdaugh, and younger son, Paul Murdaugh, multiple times on his hunting estate in Islandton. He was sentenced to life in prison.

Colleton County Sheriff's Office Det. Laura Rutland was one of the first few investigators to interview Murdaugh at the crime scene and noticed that he was wearing a clean, white t-shirt and cargo shorts, even though the former lawyer told investigators that he had tried to take Paul's pulse and turn his body over, which struck her as odd.

"Paul and Maggie were shot multiple times. Paul was shot by a shotgun, which caused catastrophic damage to the top of his head. In addition to the biological matter around his body, there was also a lot of water," Rutland, the state's first witness in the Murdaugh trial, told Fox News Digital. "And [the jury was] able to see that on Sergeant Green's body cam. It was just so odd that even Alex's shoes were as clean as they were, including the soles of the shoes."

"Anybody walking around Paul's body would have had that watery, bloody mixture on their shoes," she added.

Rutland also clarified a question Murdaugh's defense asked her in court about hair found in Maggie's hand after she was shot to death.

"I just wanted to clarify that when she had suffered her injuries, and the bullet exited the back of her head, it created a large hole, which displaced that part of her skull, including her scalp and her hair," the detective explained. "So, all around her body, there were small clumps of the back of her hair in the grass around her body. Some had fallen near her hands and her arms. And when we removed her body, some of the hair that was on her fingers. It was just a few strands went with her."

DEATH OF MURDAUGH BOAT CRASH VICTIM MALLORY BEACH IN SPOTLIGHT AT DOUBLE-MURDER TRIAL

Rutland was assigned to work the case at the time, because she was not familiar with the Murdaugh family and their family's legal legacy in the South Carolina Lowcountry.

"I got there and was kind of surprised by how many law enforcement [vehicles] there were. And I was like, ‘Okay, this must not be a normal double homicide. Something's going on,'" Rutland, the state's first witness, told Fox News Digital. "They asked me if I knew the Murdaugh family, and I didn't, so I got chosen to work with [South Carolina Law Enforcement Division Agent] David Owen. ... I went in there with the thought to just handle it like every other case."

ALEX MURDAUGH'S SUICIDE-FOR-HIRE HITMAN CURTIS ‘EDDIE’ SMITH COULD BE KEY PLAYER IN NEXT TRIAL

Rewatching video of her interview with Murdaugh, Rutland said it seemed like he was "trying to... make himself cry" when recounting what he had witnessed at the dog kennels that evening.

Murdaugh initially told investigators he hadn't been to the dog kennels at all that night. He said he had taken at nap at the house on the hunting property and then driven to see his sick mother before returning to find Maggie and Paul dead near the kennels. A video that Paul snapped on his phone later revealed Murdaugh's voice at the dog kennels just before the murders took place.

After the guilty verdict, jurors exiting the courthouse thanked Rutland and Colleton County Cpt. Jason Chapman for their work, Rutland said.

"I'm very proud of the jury that they were able to follow such a complicated case and understand all the facts and evidence that we brought to them the night of the conviction," she said. "It was kind of crazy in the courthouse afterwards with the media and everybody. We were trying to get everyone out of the courthouse safely. My captain and I just happened to come out of a side door where the jury was being escorted... and they wanted to shake our hands. I'll never forget that moment. I was very impressed with the jury and appreciative of their service to Colleton County."
