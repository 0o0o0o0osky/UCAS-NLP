Pauline Bonaparte, younger sister to Napoleon, was her brother’s favorite of their seven siblings. She was the only one who took no part in his political power plays. While her siblings were placed on thrones all over Europe, Pauline was quoted as saying: “I do not care for crowns. If I had wished for one, I should have had it; but I left that taste to my relations.”

(Was Napoleon Bonaparte an enlightened leader or tyrant?)

Born in Ajaccio, Corsica, on October 20, 1780, she was the sixth of the eight children of lawyer Charles-Marie Bonaparte and Maria Letizia Ramolino. Pauline opted for a life of amorous adventure rather than reshaping the political map of Europe. She used her beauty and boldness to conquer a long train of lovers and, despite scandals, won the admiration of the European beau monde as an icon of style.

“Few women have savored more the pleasure of being beautiful,” the French general Louis Stanislas de Girardin wrote of her. For Napoleon himself, she was “the best living creature” and “the only one who never asks for anything.” Though often frivolous and feckless, Pauline had a loyal and courageous side too. She was the only one of his siblings to visit Napoleon (and to help him financially) when he was exiled to the island of Elba in 1814 after his failed military campaign in Russia. During his second banishment, to St. Helena, after his defeat at Waterloo, Pauline even requested to spend time with him on the remote island in the southern Atlantic.

(Napoleon lost the Battle of Waterloo—here’s what went wrong.)

Pauline ... was then in the full brilliance of her beauty ... Few women have savored more the pleasure of being beautiful.



Family fortunes

Despite the death of her father when she was five, Pauline grew up in the bosom of a comfortable family until her early teens. Then, in 1793, times got harder: Her brother Lucien became embroiled in a political controversy, forcing the family to flee Corsica for the French mainland. Once in Marseille, they lived in straitened circumstances. That same year, Napoleon first made his name militarily, starting an ascent that would vastly improve his family’s fortunes.

Pauline never had the formal education that women of high social standing were expected to have to secure a wealthy husband. At age 15, her beauty was enough to catch the eye of her brother’s military comrades. After a dalliance or two, she fell for the veteran French revolutionary Stanislas Fréron. Entangled with another mistress (and 26 years Pauline’s senior), he was rejected by her mother. No end of suitors appeared. Napoleon told one aspirant, “You have nothing. She has nothing. What does that total? Nothing.” In the end, her brother persuaded her to consider Charles Leclerc. They married in 1797, and a year later the couple’s only son, Dermide, was born.

In 1801, to quell an ongoing revolution in Saint-Domingue (in what is Haiti today) and protect France’s sugar income from its colony, Napoleon (now first consul) sent Pauline’s husband to the Caribbean to lead 23,000 French soldiers. Pauline and her son followed in 1802. Leclerc achieved initial victories against the rebels, led by Toussaint L’ouverture.

(The Christmas Eve plot to blow up Napoleon.)

Leclerc’s successes were short-lived. Renewed fighting coincided with an outbreak of yellow fever that began to decimate the French troops. Amid declining morale, Pauline provided social diversion, with herself at the center, by hosting balls and fetes. She also turned the family’s mansion into a field hospital. Leclerc urged his wife to return to France, but she refused. Leclerc wrote to Napoleon that she chose to follow her husband’s fortunes for “good or ill.” In November 1802, Leclerc died from yellow fever, and Pauline and her son returned to France.

While genuinely grieving her husband’s death, Pauline soon took up romantic liaisons. Her love life would always generate gossip, but it was frequently seized on and exaggerated by Napoleon’s royalist enemies. "Pauline was often singled out by Bourbon sympathizers as a nymphomaniac who cared not whether her partner or partners were men or women, or, when in Haiti with Leclerc, whether they were his officers or Haitians who opposed the French Army,” says Flora Fraser, author of Pauline Bonaparte: Venus of Empire. “The object was always to damage, by extension, her brother’s reputation.”

Napoleon had his sights set on imperial power and knew that his reputation must be beyond reproach. His sister’s image was bound closely to his, and so, once again, he sought out a new husband for Pauline: The very rich, well-connected Prince Camillo Borghese, whose presence in the family would help Napoleon reinforce ties with French-occupied Italy. They married in June 1803.

This 1811 épis de blés, or ears of wheat, tiara belonged to Pauline. Made of gold and silver and set with diamonds, it sold at auction in 2021 for more than $850,000.



Initially, Pauline approved of the 28-year-old prince’s Mediterranean good looks, not to mention the title of princess, a generous annuity, property, and the use of the celebrated Borghese jewels. But Pauline soon grew disillusioned, and the marriage deteriorated. Among other gibes, she took to calling him “His Serene Idiot.”

Pauline’s health had begun to trouble her. In 1804, Prince Borghese took Pauline to the baths of Pisa to recover, but he didn’t allow her to bring along her son. While she was away, the six-year-old contracted a fever and died. Pauline blamed the prince. Their ill-suited match now ruptured, she persuaded Napoleon to allow her to return to Paris, rather than to Rome with Prince Borghese. Despising her husband, she once again took refuge in love affairs.

Immortal beauty

Shortly after their marriage, Borghese had commissioned Antonio Canova, the greatest neoclassical sculptor of the time, to portray his new wife. The artist wanted a mythological theme, suggesting Diana, the Roman virgin goddess of hunting.

Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.

Pauline laughed at such an incongruous idea, opting for Venus, the Roman goddess of love. Titled “Venus Victrix” (“Venus Victorious”), the resulting masterpiece has endured as Pauline’s greatest claim to fame. By having herself depicted as Venus, Pauline’s innate vanity could not be more evident. But, as Fraser notes, it also showed her “disregard for convention, and even an enjoyment in breaking with convention.”

Pauline’s decision to pose nude was notorious at the time for a woman of her station, but the sculpture’s technical virtuosity won widespread admiration when it was completed in 1808. Seen at night by torchlight, as Canova recommended, the figure’s smoothly polished marble seemed like real flesh. Today Pauline’s form continues to amaze visitors to the Galleria Borghese in Rome.

(How Beethoven went from Napoleon’s biggest fan to his worst critic.)

Napoleon seemed to ignore most of Pauline’s unconventional behavior. This choice contrasts with the man who, when named emperor of France in 1804, emphasized “good morals” and restricted the rights women had gained during the French Revolution. For Napoleon, empire was one thing and family another—and no one exemplified that contrast more than his sister.

Loyal to the last

Pauline’s health problems worsened over the years. She experienced chronic abdominal pain and traveled from spa to spa in search of relief or a cure. She often insisted on being carried in a litter to avoid walking. Her demands became increasingly capricious. She bid her attendants to act as footstools or to lay down their cloaks on the ground so she could rest.

When Napoleon was forced into exile on St. Helena in 1815, Pauline returned to Rome, where she lobbied the British authorities to set her brother free. Five years later, as reports came of Napoleon’s decline, she repeatedly asked for permission to join him and “be there when he breathes his last.” He died in 1821 while she was still awaiting a response.

("The Death of Napoleon" captures the end of a tumultuous era.)

Her own health was gradually broken by what is believed to be stomach cancer. In 1825, 20 years after separating from her husband, Pauline returned to live with him in Palazzo Borghese. It was there that she died three months later.the past and all that is in it

On March 8, 1910—113 years ago today—Raymonde de Laroche, a former Parisian stage actress, became the first licensed female pilot in the world. Nine years later she was killed when the experimental aircraft she was flying dove into the ground.

Harriet Quimby, a well-known journalist, became the first American woman to obtain a pilot’s license in 1911. She died a year later when her new plane pitched her into Boston Harbor.

In 1921, Bessie Coleman was the first Black woman to receive a pilot’s license—she had to travel to France to find a flight school that would teach her. But five years later she was killed when a wrench got caught in her plane’s controls, sending the plane plummeting.

Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.

Flying was perilous in aviation’s earliest days. The planes were “flimsy contraptions fashioned from bamboo, wire, and fabric,” according to the late historian Eileen Lebow. They didn’t have seat belts or even a roof to hold the pilot should the aircraft flip over. Yet women like Laroche, Quimby, and Coleman were willing to risk their lives for the freedom that flights promised.

“Aviation was a new profession seemingly free from the gender expectations and sex typing that limited women elsewhere,” noted historian Susan Ware at the National Air and Space Museum’s inaugural Amelia Earhart Lecture in Aviation History in 2022. “Women were getting in at the beginning.”

For many of them the thrill of flying was intoxicating but so was the opportunity to be assessed on their own merits. “These women wanted to be judged as human beings rather than as women,” says Ware.

(Women could fly before they could vote.)

Coleman especially saw flight as a path toward broader gender and racial equality. "I knew we had no aviators, neither men nor women, and I knew the Race needed to be represented along this most important line,” she said shortly after she returned to the United States from France in 1921. “I thought it my duty to risk my life to learn aviating and to encourage flying among men and women of the Race who are so far behind.” Before she died, she’d planned to open a flight school that would welcome African American aviators.

Many early women fliers shared the dream that achievement in this field would lead to more independence. As one journalist and amateur pilot wrote in 1930, “A woman who can find fulfillment in the skies will never again need to live her life in some man’s spare moments.”

Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.

Some of that independence would come from the ease of travel that aviation promised in its earliest incarnation. Many people, including Amelia Earhart, believed at first that airplanes would become as commonly owned by families as bicycles and automobiles already had.

(Flight attendants had to fight for their rights.)

Other women embraced the financial independence that they thought the new field would offer. Neta Snook, whose first solo flight was in a plane she rebuilt, made her living by offering up her plane for aerial advertising, test flying experimental aircraft, taking paying passengers up for aerial tours, and teaching beginning fliers, including Earhart. Gladys Roy, on the other hand, earned good money as a stunt pilot, dancing the Charleston and playing tennis on the wings midflight for amazed crowds at air shows. (Snook retired from aviation when she became pregnant in her mid-twenties and lived to be 95; Roy died at 25 when she accidentally stepped into a propeller.)

Sisters Katherine and Marjorie Stinson took a more long-term approach, establishing a flight school in Texas with their mother and brother that trained, among others, Canadian pilots in the run up to World War I. When the U.S. entered the war, the country’s civil aviation—including the Stinson School for Flying—was shut down. Katherine went to Europe to serve as an ambulance driver while Marjorie became an aeronautical draftsman for the Navy.

War and the development of commercial aviation conspired to dampen women’s hopes of equality in the air. Experienced women pilots such as LaRoche and Katherine Stinson volunteered to serve in their countries’ nascent air forces during World War I. They were denied, the military preferring to train unseasoned men. The same pattern occurred in World War II, although Women’s Airforce Service Pilots (WASPs) did ferry U.S. military planes as civilian pilots during the conflict. (The Soviet Union, however, had three female air combat regiments.)

Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.

The dream of every family owning a private plane never did materialize; the infrastructure required would have been too extensive. Instead, the commercial aviation industry developed, hiring men—many of whom had been trained as pilots by the military. It was no use pointing out, as Earhart did, that if women "had access to the training and equipment men had we could certainly do as well."

Helen Richey became the first female commercial pilot in 1934 but was hounded out of her job. The U.S. Commerce Department, under pressure from the all-male pilots’ union, decreed that women weren’t allowed to fly scheduled routes in bad weather (they’d previously considered “grounding female pilots for nine days a month during menstruation,” according to Ware).

There wouldn’t be another female commercial pilot until 1973, when Emily Howell Warner was hired by Frontier.European pirates cruised the coasts of North America, western Africa, and South America during the so-called golden age of piracy, the period of heightened piratical activity in the Atlantic Ocean between 1650 and 1730. And many pirates like Blackbeard and Captain Kidd rose to notoriety in part due to their Caribbean exploits during that time. But in the late 17th and early 18th centuries, some pirates shifted their geographical focus to the Indian Ocean, along Africa’s eastern coast, lured by treasure-laden ships carrying gold, silver, and gems. Their malevolent deeds created a less famous focus of piracy’s golden era, which continues to some extent today. Who were these pirates and how exactly did this lesser known aspect of piracy transpire?

(Where did pirates spend their booty?)

The allure of wealth

By the 1690s, the Indian Ocean teemed with merchant vessels that routinely carried valuable cargoes. Convoys frequently transported wealthy Muslim pilgrims and luxury goods like silks and spices between the Mughal Empire (including present-day India) and Mecca. There were also the treasures carried by the East India Companies of England, France, and the Netherlands; ships headed east transported cash to finance operations in the region, while those returning west contained fine silks, jewels, and spices they had accumulated. The most coveted treasure ships, though, belonged to the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb, who ruled his South Asian empire between 1658 until his death in 1707.

(Pirates once swashbuckled across the ancient Mediterranean.)

Pirates eyed these prospects of enormous wealth—gold, silver, and gems were much more profitable than the Caribbean’s timber, rum, and cloth—and flocked east in droves.

Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.

Arrival at St. Mary’s

As pirates arrived, they needed a safe harbor to refit their ships and escape storms, as well as a place to enjoy their loot. That place became Madagascar, 250 miles off the African coast, with St. Mary’s Island off its remote northeast coast being the most famous stronghold. The Indigenous Malagasy had until then successfully warded off Europeans eyeing the island’s strategic location along major shipping channels between Europe and Asia.

(On the trail of Ireland’s legendary pirate queen.)

Then along came English “trader” Adam Baldridge. Wanted for murder in British Jamaica, he fled to St. Mary’s Island, subdued the locals (no doubt through vicious means), and set up a pirate haven in 1691. He established an illicit business with a New York merchant in which he traded pirates’ booty for European wares such as tobacco and food, providing a thriving economic network to support the pirates’ way of life.

Baldridge built an incredibly fortified bastion on St. Mary’s, which allowed more than a thousand pirates hide out there in the 1690s, enjoying the good life of rum, women, and safety in between looting raids.

Pirate success stories

Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.

Two of most successful European pirates in the Indian Ocean were the English pirate John Taylor and his French counterpart, Olivier Levasseur, also known as La Buse, who worked together in 1721 to attack the Nossa Senhora de Cabo. The ship, carrying important passengers including the archbishop of Goa and count of Ericeira, Viceroy of Portuguese India—along with diamonds valued at 500,000 British pounds and rare Asian silks and porcelain worth 375,000 British pounds—had been damaged at sea and was docked at the East African island of Reunion for repairs. The men easily seized the vessel and made away with booty worth more than 900,000 British pounds. Tales like this encouraged pirates to troll the Indian Ocean, looking for vessels to plunder.

Another hugely successful pirate was Henry Avery. The Englishman got his start as a member of a merchant ship before becoming first mate on the privateering ship Charles II, employed by the king of Spain. Aboard the Charles II, Avery convinced the other men to commit mutiny and make away with the ship. The mutiny was met with great success, after which Avery indicated he was turning to piracy: “I am bound to Madagascar, with a Design of making my own Fortune,” he stated. He renamed the ship Fancy, customized it to be speedier under sail, and headed east. Known as the king of the pirates, Avery operated for only a couple of years, though he spearheaded perhaps piracy’s most lucrative raid.

(Pirate portrayals—from Blackbeard to Captain Kidd—are more fantasy than fact.)

An ill-conceived pirate plot Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited. A map from ca. 1572 shows a panoramic view of the port at Calicut (today known as Kozikhode). Illustration via Buyenlarge Archive, UIG / Bridgeman Images Not all fortune-seeking pirates in the Indian Ocean, however, were victorious. Take Dutch pirate Dirk Chivers, for example. He is infamous for holding four ships hostage in the harbor at Calicut, Kerala, in southern India. He demanded 10,000 British pounds from the Indian governor and East India Company, who countered with 5,000 British pounds. Offended by the offer, Chivers raised the “bloody colors”—a red flag that meant certain death. He set one of the hostage ships on fire, and a compromise was offered, 40,000 rupees. This time, Chivers agreed to take it, but when the money failed to show, he burned a second ship.



What Chivers failed to realize was that the Indian government and the East India Company were working on another plot. They had messaged pirates in India to attack Chivers and his men, which forced them to flee the harbor. They’d have to find their riches elsewhere.

Piracy’s greatest heist

In July 1695, word spread that the Grand Mughal of India’s treasure fleet was returning from its annual pilgrimage to Mecca. Henry Avery joined forces with other pirates, including Thomas Tew, a Rhode Islander privateer-turned-pirate. They waited several weeks before their big prizes approached: the Fateh Muhammed and the Ganj-i-Sawai. The pirates first attacked the Fateh Muhammed, the flagship’s escort. There wasn’t much of a fight, and the pirates hauled 50,000 to 60,000 British pounds—but the pirates wanted more. Avery then went after the flagship, the mighty Ganj-i-Sawai, equipped with 62 cannon and hundreds of musketeers. A bloody battle ensued, with the frightened captain finally seeking cover below decks and the remaining Indians surrendering. The haul from the Ganj-i-Sawai was hundreds of thousands of pounds in gold, silver, and jewels, worth tens of millions of dollars today—perhaps piracy’s richest haul ever.

Alas, it didn’t turn out very well for Tew and his crew. Tew died during the battle for the ships, and Avery refused to share more than just a small amount of the plunder with the other pirates. Such was the pirate’s life.

End of an era

By the end of the 18th century, as Europeans began colonizing throughout the Indian Ocean region, the area became difficult for pirates to operate in, but they never truly disappeared. Examples of piracy in the Indian Ocean exist well into the 21st century, particularly off the coast of Somalia.

How certain foods lower your risk of diseaseWhen limestone quarry workers in Germany’s Neander Valley discovered fossilized bones in 1856, they thought they’d uncovered the remains of a bear. In fact, they’d stumbled upon something that would change history: evidence of an extinct species of ancient human predecessors who walked the Earth between at least 400,000 and 40,000 years ago.

Researchers soon realized that they had already encountered these human relatives in earlier fossils that had been found, and misidentified, throughout the early 19th century. The discovery galvanized scientists eager to explore new theories of evolution, sparking a worldwide fossil hunt and tantalizing the public with the possibility of a mysterious sister species that once dominated Europe.

Now known as Neanderthals—so named by geologist William King—Homo neanderthalensis are humans’ closest known relatives. Here’s what to know about our human ancestors, including how they lived and why they died out.

Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.

What is a Neanderthal?

At first glance, fossilized Neanderthal bones seem human-like. But a closer look reveals the characteristics that differentiate our ancient ancestors from modern Homo sapiens.

Neanderthals looked similar to humans but had more prominent brows, protruding faces, and rib cages that were shorter, deeper, and wider. In addition, their eye sockets were much larger, though it is unclear if their vision differed from ours. Researchers believe that Neanderthal brains were roughly the same size as ours, although they were more elongated. Though debates on the size and structures of Neanderthal brains still rage today, researchers agree that the average male Neanderthal was about 5 foot 4 inches tall, while females stood at about 5 feet.

(You may have more Neanderthal DNA than you think.)

These hominids once lived throughout Eurasia. Researchers believe that due to the species’ adaptation to the region’s cold climates, Neanderthals had compact, massive musculature and would have required up to 4,480 calories a day to survive.

Megafauna like mammoths, elephants, and woolly rhinoceros made hunting an important facet of Neanderthal life. Living and traveling in small groups, they used tools like spears to satiate their meat-heavy diet. They also ate plants—which MIT geobiologist Ainara Sistiaga has said is evidence that Neanderthals “probably ate what was available in different situations, seasons and climates.”

Sometimes, this included eating their own: In 2016, scientists studying Neanderthal remains from a cave in what is now Belgium found “unambiguous evidence of Neanderthal cannibalism in Northern Europe.”

Were Neanderthals intelligent?

Researchers initially assumed Neanderthals were brutish, hairy thugs capable only of crude thought and bloody hunting. But some scientists have changed their tune as evidence has accumulated of some surprisingly human-like characteristics among these human ancestors.

Neanderthals used tools in domestic and hunting contexts, flaking rocks to create weapons, scrapers, and axes. Woodworking was also common—they cut and whittled sticks they used to dig or form spears.

(A look inside the world of Neanderthals.)

Despite their assumed ability to withstand the cold, Neanderthals are also thought to have processed animal hides and crafted clothing that could cover up to 80 percent of their bodies. Like humans, they are thought to have covered their feet and other sensitive body parts, but since the clothing has long since disintegrated, researchers can only infer how Neanderthals may have dressed.

Another breakthrough was the discovery that Neanderthals may have been capable of symbolic thought. A few archaeological sites have yielded decorated eagle talons and objects thought to have been used in burial rituals—evidence, some say, of advanced thought and tradition. Then, in 2018, researchers announced they’d discovered evidence of cave paintings from 65,000 years ago—the oldest artworks of their kind. But the abstract nature of this art continues to fuel debates among scientists about how complex their mental capacities truly were.

When and why did Neanderthals go extinct?

Whatever their cognitive abilities, Neanderthals were ultimately doomed. However, their extinction is just as contentious as other facets of their lives, and scientists still debate what caused them to disappear around 40,000 years ago.

(Ancient DNA reveals new twists in Neanderthal migration.)

Researchers know that in at least some cases, Neanderthals coexisted and even mated with Homo sapiens, which emerged in Africa about 300,000 years ago. But Homo sapiens eventually won out genetically, and the vast majority of modern humans' genes come from our African ancestors. Some surmise that competition from humans for food and shelter, or evolution that selected for more successful human traits, contributed to the Neanderthals’ extinction. Others think that because Neanderthals lived in such small groups, they simply became outnumbered by humans.

Another hypothesis involves climate change: Scientists have documented a thousand-year-long cold snap in central Europe that coincided with the Neanderthals’ extinction about 40,000 years ago and that could have depopulated the species. Cooling is thought to have been less severe in areas populated by Homo sapiens, and those who embrace this theory believe that once Neanderthal populations declined, humans moved in and eventually became the dominant species worldwide.

Still another theory involves weapons: Perhaps early humans had better weapons and simply outbattled the Neanderthals.

Modern humans and Neanderthal DNA

Despite their species’ demise, fascinating remnants of Neanderthals can be found in the genetic material of some modern humans. Up to 4 percent of the DNA of humans living outside of Africa, the cradle of Homo sapiens, can be traced back to Neanderthals. That overlap shows that Neanderthals did interbreed with humans.

(How do Neanderthal genes affect your health?)

“Ironically,” write prehistory experts Peter C. Kjærgaard, Mark Maslin, and Trine Kellberg Nielsen, “with a current world population of about 8 billion people, this means that there has never been more Neanderthal DNA on Earth.”

Given how long it’s been since Neanderthals roamed Eurasia, it’s impossible to truly reconstruct how they lived and died. But the mystery of these human ancestors—and tantalizing hints that they were much like us—continues to drive research, and controversy, to this day.

Editor's note: This article has been updated to clarify how Neanderthal faces and bodies differed from modern humans. A reference to Neanderthal DNA in modern humans has also been revised to specify that the DNA was found in humans living outside of Africa.One of the greatest villains of the Roman Empire is the empress Messalina. The third wife of the emperor Claudius, she is remembered today as the most promiscuous woman in Rome, the nymphomaniac empress. The Messalina in the modern imagination is a pinnacle of uncontrolled, violent, irrational, and impulsive behavior. Her sexual appetite is unrivaled, and her motivations quite wicked. When Mikhail Bulgakov was filling Satan’s ball in The Master and Margarita, he included Messalina as a guest. When Charlotte Bronte needed to describe the mad wife in the attic in Jane Eyre, Bronte likened her to a German vampire as well as Messalina. Of all the scandalous women who violated Roman gender roles, Messalina has come down through history as the most scandalous of all.

(Blood and betrayal turned Rome from republic to empire.)

Noble beginnings

Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.

Valeria Messalina was at most 18 in A.D. 38 when she married her only husband, Tiberius Claudius Nero Germanicus. Claudius on the other hand was a 47-year-old, twice-divorced, father of two. The pair were first cousins once removed, both descended from the Divine Augustus’s sister Octavia.

The marriage was a great honor for Claudius, as his previous wives had been of moderate prestige compared to Messalina. His marriage to a descendant of Octavia coincided with his belated entry into public life and was a sign that the new emperor—his nephew Caligula—approved of him and was tying him closely to the line of succession.

(Caligula thought he was a god, and it got him killed.)

For Messalina, however, the marriage was likely less thrilling. Her new husband had spent his entire life until this point as a family embarrassment. He had visible disabilities that allegedly prompted his mother to refer to him as a monster, his great-uncle Augustus to forbid him from sitting with the rest of the family in public, and his uncle Tiberius to banish him from any public office. Imperial Rome was an unfriendly place for disabled people, and no one knew that better than Claudius. He had seen his siblings receive glorious honors and advantageous marriages. Claudius had no prestige and brought little but his bloodline to enhance Messalina’s own. It is hard to imagine that she looked forward to marriage to a man 30 years her senior whose achievements she could not even brag about.

Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.

The pair had two children in quick succession, and Claudius unexpectedly—and controversially—became emperor. After Caligula was assassinated in A.D. 41, Claudius took refuge in the army camps and haggled for two days to convince the Senate to accept him as emperor.

Messalina’s husband, with no experience and little promise, had surpassed everyone’s expectations when he took power. Still in her early 20s and prepared for a life of aristocratic leisure, Messalina had become an empress. Just weeks after her husband ascended to the Roman throne, she made history by being the first woman to give birth to a Roman emperor’s son.

Importance of being Julia Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited. Messalina with her son, Britannicus, as a Roman statue from circa A.D. 50. ​ RMN-Grand Palais The Julia family (Julii) was held in high regard by the Roman people, who looked to the family as successors of Julius Caesar (Emperor Augustus was Julius Caesar’s great-nephew and adopted son). Lineage was a key factor in the match between Claudius and Messalina. The 30-year age gap and general incompatibility between them were overlooked in favor of their heritage. The pair’s marriage formed one of the “purest” connections to the Julio-Claudian dynasty, in that it descended directly from Octavia, sister of Augustus. Tiberius, Caligula, and Claudius all descended from Livia, Augustus’s third wife, and were thereby linked also to the Claudian line​.

Messalina's reputation

Most information on Messalina’s relationship with Claudius comes from the first and second-century A.D. historians Tacitus and Suetonius, each writing decades after her death during a time critical of Rome’s early emperors. Suetonius writes of the pair in The Twelve Caesars, but his descriptions are short and matter-of-fact. Tacitus has much more to say on the subject.

Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.

Messalina’s first years as Claudius’s wife and empress were not included in these works, so it is unclear if her notoriety was present from the start of her husband’s rule. Roman men tended to perceive women as being constitutionally corrupt, unlike men, who became corrupted. Roman law viewed women as perpetual minors and distrusted them to control their own property.

(Claudius's next wife, Agrippina, was a master strategist. She paid the price for it.)

It is possible that opinions of Messalina changed over time, but when Tacitus’s narrative picks up around A.D. 47, six years into Claudius’s reign, the historian thinks Messalina’s a monster. Tacitus’s first mention of the empress describes her manipulating her husband to punish two of her personal enemies: Valerius Asiaticus and Poppaea Sabina. Asiaticus owned the lovely Gardens of Lucullus, which Messalina coveted. She spread rumors of an extramarital affair between Asiaticus and Poppaea (who had taken a lover Messalina desired for herself). Claudius had the pair arrested and Asiaticus killed. Poppaea was imprisoned, and Tacitus reports she died by suicide after repeated harassment from Messalina’s agents.

In Tacitus’s telling, Messalina frequently uses the judicial system and the functions of the state for her own selfish ends. Through them, she obtains revenge on those who cross her, reject her sexual advances, or spark her envy. She exiles relatives and executes rivals. She lies about omens and circulates rumors to scare her husband into doing her bidding. She makes the personal political.

Marriage and betrayal

Messalina’s actions ultimately brought her down. Roman historians reported her undoing and subsequent murder with glee and snickering delight. Tacitus is again the chief source of information on Messalina’s final scandal. Other authors retold Messalina’s story, including the Roman poet Juvenal who wrote a scathing condemnation of her in his Satires, composed in the late first or early second century A.D. Writing a century later, Roman historian Cassius Dio continued the tradition of rendering Messalina as a villain, calling her “the most abandoned and lustful of women.”

The episode begins in A.D. 48, when Messalina starts a love affair with Senator Gaius Silius. Silius’s complicity varies across sources; in Juvenal and Dio he is a passive victim of her dominance, while in Tacitus he is an enthusiastic participant. Messalina lavishes him with decadent gifts, from family heirlooms to houses. Their affair proceeds until it becomes public knowledge. Silius divorces his wife, but Messalina cannot free herself from her emperor husband.

(Inside the conspiracy to kill Julius Caesar.)

The adulterers then do something so unexpected—so open and shocking—that even the ancient sources can barely believe it. The couple hold their own wedding while Claudius is out of town in Ostia. Messalina dons the yellow veil of a bride and proceeds publicly through the streets to Silius’s home, where they exchange vows. They then throw a raucous party that includes, according to Tacitus, Messalina wantonly letting her hair down.

The actual events and meaning of that day are still debated by modern historians. Was this a real wedding or a performance? Was it an attempted coup rather than a brazen affront? Some characterize the day as an attempt to overthrow Claudius, motivated entirely by political ambition to rule. The truth will never be known because neither conspirator survived the night.

Rumors of their wedding party, whether real or staged, reach Claudius in Ostia very quickly. To break the news, his administrators send his two favorite mistresses to tell him that his wife has publicly divorced him by marrying another man. Claudius, in Tacitus’s telling, panics, believing that Messalina and Silius are attempting to overthrow him. Claudius has them immediately arrested. Guards escort Messalina to the Gardens of Lucullus, and Silius is brought before Claudius at the army camps. Silius and his allies are executed on the spot for treason, and then Silius’s name vanishes from history.

Death of an empress

Claudius procrastinates over Messalina’s fate. She is his wife of a decade, the mother of his children, and a woman he loves by all accounts. He softens and decides to give her a hearing the next day. Claudius’s supporters fear that Messalina will escape punishment, so they take matters into their own hands. They falsely tell Roman centurions and a tribune to go to the gardens and execute Messalina on the orders of the emperor.

Messalina is in the gardens with her mother. Tacitus reports that even when she is trapped, Messalina does not give up. She tries to find a way out of the situation, but to no avail. When the soldiers arrive, they give her the option to kill herself, but she is unable to do it. Tacitus sneers that she was so lacking in virtue that she couldn’t even take her own life. One of the tribunes runs her through and ends her life.

Tacitus reported that Claudius is unmoved at the news of his wife’s death: “[H]e called for a cup and went through the routine of the banquet. Even in the days that followed, he betrayed no symptoms of hatred or of joy, of anger or of sadness, or, in fine, of any human emotion.” The Roman government decrees a damnatio memoriae against Messalina, striking her name from public and private places and destroying her statues. But this official erasure did not cause Messalina to fade from memory. Rather, her sexual appetites and bigamous wedding gave rise to rumors, jokes, and gossip that would overtake her every other action in the historical imagination, including her political machinations.

Erasing the past Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited. The Picture Art Collection/Alamy Romans who lived exemplary lives could be pronounced gods after death, but villains faced the postmortem punishment of damnatio memoriae, of having one’s name erased from history. If the government declared it, one’s name would be struck from public and private records, property seized, and portraits defaced. Caligula and Nero were two early emperors who were damned. Roman women could also be condemned; most were sentenced along with their husbands. Only a few, such as Messalina and Julia the Elder (daughter of Augustus Caesar), received their own condemnation outright. The practice continued into later eras. In the early 200s, Emperor Caracalla condemned his brother Geta after murdering him. Portraits of Geta, even as a boy like this one, were defaced, and it became a crime to say his name.

Rumors and innuendo

These jokes and whispers started early. Pliny the Elder, who was a young army officer serving in Germany during Claudius’s early rule, wrote an encyclopedia of natural phenomena, in which he included musings on mammalian sexuality. Humans, he notes, are the only animals who don’t have breeding seasons and who are never sated when it comes to sex. As an illustration, he tells the reader about Empress Messalina, who engaged in a competition with a sex worker to see who could take the most lovers. After 25 “embraces,” Messalina won.

A generation later, the anecdote grew even more outrageous when it was related by noted misanthrope Juvenal in his Satires. Messalina appears in the section on why he hates women. Calling her the “Imperial Whore,” Juvenal claims that every night Messalina disguised herself in a blonde wig—a hair color associated with barbarians—and worked at a low-class brothel, where she would have sex until the sun came up. She would be sent away “exhausted but not yet satisfied.”

Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.

By A.D. 220, when Cassius Dio was writing his Roman History, Messalina’s imagined brothel has moved into the imperial palace, where she invites men to buy sex from her and from other aristocratic women, some of whom are forced by Messalina into sex work. Dio also related a tale concerning a dancer, Mnester, who finds himself the focus of Messalina’s unwelcome advances. He rejects her repeatedly until Messalina complains to her husband that Mnester will not obey her, pretending that he is merely insubordinate. Claudius, none the wiser, orders Mnester to do whatever his wife commands, and thus Mnester must submit. This scene seems ripped directly from Greek and Roman comedy: The cuckolded husband and the unfaithful, sexually rapacious wife are stock characters. The story shows that Messalina’s real fall was so dramatic that anything could be said about her and be believed.

(Inside the decadent love affair of Cleopatra and Mark Antony.)

These kinds of stories delegitimize Messalina and reveal how Roman (and modern) misogyny works. In the sources that purport to be telling history—Tacitus, Suetonius, and Dio—Messalina is promiscuous but also clever, calculating, and cruel. She schemes with allies both within her household and the Senate to concoct plans and accumulate power. She uses the law courts and alliances to torment her enemies, and she runs a citywide network of spies and informers. She gathers information and deploys it to control her husband and thus control an empire. All these things are undoubtedly nefarious, but they demonstrate a certain respect for Messalina as a complete person.

Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.

The popular imagination has not dwelled on these aspects. Writers from Pliny and Juvenal to Bronte and Chuck Palahniuk employ Messalina only to highlight her lascivious nature. She is not a political operator but merely a wanton woman operating in the shadows of the bedroom. Sex scandals remove her from the masculine, public sphere of power and politics and place her back where women belong: in the domestic, private sphere of wife and mother. Her sharper edges soften when she is diminished into the simplest category of female villain: a woman who enjoys sex a lot.

Messalina’s true scandals were that she overstepped the defined boundaries of an empress’s appropriate place and engaged too openly in the cruel politics of the Roman imperial system, culminating in a very strange but very public coup attempt. To remember her as merely the “Imperial Whore” and “most promiscuous woman in Rome” does her a disservice. Messalina was a much more complicated, and interesting, scandal than that.the past and all that is in it

Many of us look at the stranglehold that gender-based oppression has on our societies and wonder if there was a time when men didn’t have this much power, when femininity and masculinity didn’t mean what they do now. When we search for powerful women in ancient history, when we try to identify precedents for equality in the distant past, perhaps we also betray our longing for an alternative in a world in which we fear there may be none. (The truth behind Egypt’s female pharaohs and their power.)

Patriarchy—giving all power and authority to the father—can sometimes seem like a vast conspiracy stretching into deep time. The word itself has become devastatingly monolithic, encompassing all the ways in which the world’s women, girls, and nonbinary people are abused and unfairly treated, from domestic violence and rape to the gender pay gap and moral double standards. The sheer scale of it feels out of our control. But how old and how universal is it really?

Male domination is not universal. There are many matrilineal societies, organized through mothers rather than fathers, dotted all over the world.

Historians, anthropologists, archaeologists, and feminists have been fascinated by this question—and as a science journalist, I’ve been preoccupied with it for years. In 1973 sociologist Steven Goldberg published The Inevitability of Patriarchy, a book arguing that fundamental biological differences between men and women run so deep that in every iteration of human society, a patriarchal system would always win out. Whichever way the pie was cut, men—in his view naturally more powerful and aggressive—would end up with the bigger slice. (The best and worst countries to be a woman.)

The problem with this is, male domination isn’t universal. There are many matrilineal societies—organized through mothers rather than fathers, with name and property passed from mother to daughter—around the world. In some regions, matrilineal traditions are thought to date back thousands of years.

For decades Western scholars have invented theories to explain why these societies exist. Some claim that matriliny survives only among hunter-gatherers or simple agriculturists, not in large-scale societies. Others say it works best when men are often away at war, leaving women in charge at home. Still others argue that matriliny ends as soon as people start keeping cattle, because men want to control these resources—linking patriarchy to property and land. (Read how women are stepping up to remake Rwanda.)

Always, though, matrilineal societies are framed as unusual cases, “beset by special strains, as fragile and rare, possibly even doomed to extinction,” as Washington State University anthropologist Linda Stone puts it. In academic circles, the problem is known as the matrilineal puzzle. Patriliny, on the other hand, is seen to need no explanation. It just is.

When matriliny thrived in India In India, where I once lived, the Nairs of the southern state of Kerala had powerful matrilineal families until relatively recently. They were ruled over by an influential aristocracy, with people living in grand extended households.

“Nair women always had the security of the homes they were born in throughout their lives and were not dependent on their husbands,” writes historian Manu Pillai. “And they were effectively at par with men when it came to sexual rights.”

No single theory can explain why matriliny in Kerala declined. It was a gradual shift, driven by British colonialists and Christian missionaries shocked at the power and freedom that women had, combined with changing social norms as people traveled more widely in the 19th century.

Remnants of matriliny did survive. Kerala is still recognized as being far more gender equal than other parts of India. —AS

In 2019 researchers at Vanderbilt University attempted to solve this puzzle, analyzing matrilineal communities to see if they did have anything in common. Globally 590 societies were known to be traditionally patrilineal, 362 were bilateral, meaning they acknowledged descent through both parents, and another 160 were recognized as matrilineal. Biologist Nicole Creanza, who worked on the research, says the team tested popular theories about matriliny like those above—but none held true in every case.

One factor that did seem to affect a society’s move away from matriliny, says Creanza, was “when populations had property, not in terms of land but movable, transmissible wealth, where if your offspring inherited this thing that you have, they would be potentially better off.” But even this wasn’t consistent. Each society was just too complicated to reduce to simple factors, be they biological, environmental, or anything else. “As far in as you can zoom,” she says, “you can find more and more complexity.” (In the 16th century B.C., three queens led Egypt against Hyksos invaders and won.)

Anthropologists insist there are no female-led matriarchies, if by matriarchy we mean the direct opposite of patriarchy. In his 1680 text Patriarcha, the English political theorist Sir Robert Filmer defined patriarchy as the natural rule of a father over his family and a king over his state. But what we usually see in matrilineal societies is women and men sharing power. Even if significant authority lies with brothers or uncles, it’s often authority that depends upon circumstances, or diffuse power more than absolute. (Lakshmi Bai became an icon of freedom in India.)

What characterizes matrilineal societies, as Stone has written, is “considerable variation” in “authority, power, and influence among both males and females.” There would have been even more variation in the past. In prehistory, social norms were constantly moving. What can appear from one point of view to be an instability resolving itself—a shift from matriliny to patriliny, for instance—may from another point of view be a move from one relatively stable state to another, Creanza explains.

Everywhere, people have always pushed for their societies to be structured differently, for the oppressed to have more freedoms or privileges. “Anyone, given half a chance, will prefer equality and justice to inequality and injustice,” writes political theorist Anne Phillips. “Subservience does not, on the whole, come naturally to people.” (The raised fist is a global symbol of fighting oppression.)

Nowhere do women defer to men without struggle. For centuries, from the United States to Iran, they’ve fought for more rights and privileges.

Sociologist Goldberg’s argument was that if a pattern of behavior is universal, it probably has a biological basis, and that given how little political power women have, they must feel themselves to be naturally subordinate. But as Phillips explains, nowhere do women defer to men without struggle. For centuries, from the United States to Iran, they’ve fought for more rights and privileges. Viewed this way, we might ask why matrilineal societies are still thought of as unusually unstable. Globally, impassioned movements for gender equality—sometimes tipping into violent protest—indicate that patriarchy is not as stable as it seems either. Perhaps the real matrilineal puzzle isn’t the existence of some female-focused societies but the bizarre preponderance of male-focused ones. (The roots of International Women’s Day are more radical than you think.)

“I consider the oppression of women to be a system,” sociologist Christine Delphy says. “An institution which exists today cannot be explained by the simple fact that it existed in the past...even if this past is recent.”

If we resign ourselves to accepting our lot as part of who we are by nature, we give up on understanding how it might have come about. When we settle the case for patriarchy on something as simple as biological difference, even though the evidence points to a reality that’s far more complex and contingent, we lose the capacity to recognize just how fragile it might be. We stop asking how inequality works or the ways in which it is being reinvented. (Around the world, women are taking charge of their future.)

The most dangerous part of any form of human oppression is that it can make people believe that there are no alternatives. We see this in the old fallacies of race, caste, and class. The question for any theory of male domination is why this one form of inequality should be treated as the exception.

​This story appears in the April 2023 issue of National Geographic magazine.In the dark days of winter, a new year begins. But January wasn't always the start of the new year. At the dawn of modern calendar-keeping, the winter months went unnamed in the calendars that gave rise to today’s most popular system of marking time.

Named after Janus, the god of time, transitions, and beginnings, January was an invention of the ancient Romans. Here's the story of the month's wild ride—a tale of astronomical miscalculation, political tweaking, and calendar confusion.

The first Roman calendar

Humans have been marking time on calendars for at least 10,000 years, but the methods they used varied from the start. The Mesolithic people of Britain tracked the phases of the moon. Ancient Egyptians looked to the sun. And the Chinese combined both methods into a lunisolar calendar that’s still used today.

(Why Lunar New Year typically prompts the world's largest annual migration.)

The modern calendar used in most of the world, though, evolved during the Roman Republic. Though it was attributed to Romulus, the polity's founder and first king, it’s likely the calendar developed from other dating systems designed by the Babylonians, Etruscans, and ancient Greeks.

As Romans' scientific knowledge and social structures changed over time, so did their calendar. The Romans tweaked their official calendar several times from the republic’s founding in 509 B.C. until its dissolution in 27 B.C.

The first iteration was a scant 10 months long and paid homage to what counted in early Roman society: agriculture and religious ritual. The 304-day calendar year began in March (Martius), named after the Roman god Mars. It continued until December, which was harvest time in temperate Rome.

The Romans linked each year to the date of the city’s founding. Thus, the modern year 753 B.C. was considered year one in ancient Rome.

The initial calendar included six 30-day months and four 31-day months. The first four months were named for gods like Juno (June); the last six were consecutively numbered in Latin, giving rise to month names such as September (the seventh month, named after the Latin word for seven, septem). When the harvest ended, so did the calendar; the winter months were simply unnamed.

Rome's lunar calendar

The 10-month calendar didn't last long, though. In the seventh century B.C., around the reign of Rome's second king, Numa Pompilius, the calendar received a lunar makeover. The revision involved adding 50 days and borrowing a day from each of the 10 existing months to create two new, 28-day-long winter months: Ianuarius (honoring the god Janus) and Februarius (honoring Februa, a Roman purification festival).

The new calendar was anything but perfect. Since Romans believed odd numbers were auspicious, they attempted to divide the year into odd-numbered months; the only exception was February, which was at the end of the year and considered unlucky. There was another issue: The calendar relied on the moon, not the sun. Since the moon's cycle is 29.5 days, the calendar regularly fell out of sync with the seasons it was intended to mark.

In an attempt to clear up the confusion, Romans observed an extra month, called Mercedonius, every two or three years. But it wasn't applied consistently, and various rulers added to the confusion by renaming months.

"The situation was made worse because the calendar was not a publicly available document," writes historian Robert A. Hatch. "It was guarded by the priests whose job it was to make it work and determine the dates of religious holidays, festivals, and the days when business could and could not be conducted."

The birth of the Julian calendar

Finally, in 45 B.C., Julius Caesar demanded a reformed version that became known as the Julian calendar. It was designed by Sosigenes of Alexandria, an astronomer and mathematician who proposed a 365-day calendar with a leap year every four years. Though he had overestimated the length of the year by about 11 minutes, the calendar was now mostly in sync with the sun.

(Leap year saved our societies from chaos—for now, at least.)

Caesar’s new calendar had another innovation: a new year beginning on January 1, the day its consuls—a pair of men who constituted the republic's executive branch—took office. But though the Julian calendar would stick around for centuries, the date of its new year wasn’t always honored by its adopters. Instead, Christians celebrated the new year on various feast days.

Aside from a few tweaks by other Roman rulers, the Julian calendar remained largely the same until 1582, when Pope Gregory XIII adjusted the calendar to more accurately reflect the amount of time it takes for the Earth to travel around the sun. The old calendar had been 365.25 days long; the new calendar was 365.2425 days long. The new calendar also shifted the dates, which had drifted by about two weeks, back in sync with seasonal shifts.

Only with Gregory’s 1582 reform did January 1 really stick as the beginning of the new year—for many. Not everyone switched to the new Gregorian calendar, and as a result the Christmas holiday falls in January for members of Eastern Orthodox churches.

(Here's why the Orthodox church rejected the Gregorian calendar.)

While the modern world mainly syncs to the Gregorian calendar, other calendars have lived on. As a result, different cultures acknowledge different dates as the start of the new year—and have festivals, rituals and holidays, like Nowruz, Rosh Hashanah, and Chinese New Year—to celebrate.Former president of the United States Jimmy Carter wrote the following essay for the February 2002 issue to introduce National Geographic's four-part series "Challenges for Humanity." The February issue focused on the global fight to control disease.

Ours is an age of complexity, contradiction, and challenge. As we enter the 21st century, we have wealth and technology unmatched in human experience, and the fortunate few who live in the world's developed nations are almost inevitably propelled toward a future enriched by advances in computers, communication, and life sciences.

But for most of the world's people the glittering opportunities of the new century are beyond reach. There are more than six billion of us on Earth, and by 2100 we may number ten billion. Most will live in urban centers, and many are likely to live short and impoverished lives, lacking the wealth or awareness to address problems of life in crowded cities: disease, inadequate food, and unsafe water.

(3 ways Jimmy Carter changed the world for the better.)

We face tremendous challenges as populations soar, mostly in the poorer nations, and as consumption increases in the industrialized world. We must find ways to lessen the burden on Earth's resources, and we must encourage better stewardship of the planet so that all of us live in a clean and productive environment. The decisions we make in the decades to come will affect not only all of human civilization but also the fate of thousands of species representing millions of years of evolution.

All too often our fondest expectations are frustrated. Louis Pasteur, father of the science of microbiology and a key figure in the development of vaccines in the 1880s, suggested that humans had the power "to make parasitic maladies disappear from the face of the globe."

(Why vaccines are critical to keeping disease at bay.)

Yet since then hundreds of millions of people have died of infectious diseases—tuberculosis, malaria, AIDS, dengue, smallpox, cholera, plague, influenza, and scores of others. And after 30 years of discoveries in molecular biology—including DNA cloning, the sequencing of the human genome, and stunning new developments in techniques for human stem-cell research—we still face the daily tragedy of preventable human illnesses, some ancient and others new, unpredicted, and even more virulent.

How can we heal our planet and achieve an Earth that nurtures humanity and nature in all their diversity? As individuals we can act to reduce our risk of exposure to disease and extend care to others. As communities and as nations we can educate our citizens, legislate ethically and wisely, and support organizations that conduct research and help those who are ill.

Perhaps the most important challenge for the new century is to share wealth, opportunities, and responsibilities between the rich and the poor—for a world where the chasm between rich and poor grows wider will be neither stable nor secure. So far we have not made enough of a commitment to this goal. Nearly a billion people are illiterate. More than half the world's people have little or no health care and less than two dollars a day for food, clothing, and shelter. Some 1.3 billion live on less than one dollar a day. At the same time, the average household income of an American family is more than $55,000 a year, with much of the industrialized world enjoying the same, and in some cases an even higher, standard of material blessings.

The best measurement of a nation's wealth is its gross national product (GNP)—the total output of goods and services. The nations of the European Union have set a public goal of sharing four-tenths of one percent of their GNP with the developing world. But the United States and most other rich nations fall far short of this goal. Our contribution must increase greatly if we are to face future challenges to humanity with any real hope of success.

A partial answer to the problem lies in a growing number of private efforts, some quite small. For instance, during the past 20 years the Carter Center has focused more than half its effort and resources on health care in Africa and Latin America. Experts have helped us identify some of the diseases we can hope to eradicate. One is caused by a parasite called guinea worm.

When our guinea worm program started, more than 3.5 million people had this painful, debilitating disease, mostly in remote parts of Africa where only contaminated water is available to drink.

We have now reduced this number by 98 percent. Only 70,000 people remain affected—almost all of them in the war zone of southern Sudan—and we are working hard to address their plight. In our fight against river blindness, another tropical disease, we have traveled to villages to treat more than seven million people each year—none of whom now will face possible blindness from the bite of a little black fly.

(Read Jimmy Carter's 2016 letter to Nat Geo about river blindness.)

The success of these efforts reaffirms my faith that this is a time not for despair but for a global commitment to make the most of our scientific knowledge to address the problems of our age.

Over the next year National Geographic will highlight challenges for humanity in the 21st century: the global fight to control disease, to make our food safe and our water clean, to live together fruitfully in megacities. The problems may seem insurmountable, but they are not. We have the tools; we have brilliant, dedicated people to find answers. All we need is a sense of sharing and the will to change. The will can grow from understanding. Once we understand, we can care, and once we care, we can change.It’s been a year since Russia invaded Ukraine, and the battle continues. Military and civilian deaths and injuries on both sides have been estimated in the hundreds of thousands, and millions more Ukrainians have been displaced. What set the stage for today’s conflict? Here’s a look back at the long, intertwined history of the contentious neighbors.

The two countries’ shared heritage goes back more than a thousand years to a time when Kyiv, now Ukraine’s capital, was at the center of the first Slavic state, Kyivan Rus, the birthplace of both Ukraine and Russia. In A.D. 988 Volodymyr the Great, the pagan prince of Novgorod and grand prince of Kyiv, accepted the Orthodox Christian faith and was baptized in the Crimean city of Chersonesus. From that moment on, Russian leader Vladimir Putin recently declared, “Russians and Ukrainians are one people, a single whole.”

Yet over the past 10 centuries, Ukraine has repeatedly been carved up by competing powers. Mongol warriors from the east conquered Kyivan Rus in the 13th century. In the 16th century Polish and Lithuanian armies invaded from the west. In the 17th century, war between the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Tsardom of Russia brought lands to the east of the Dnieper River under Russian imperial control. The east became known as "Left Bank" Ukraine; lands to the west of the Dnieper, or "Right Bank," were ruled by Poland.

More than a century later, in 1793, right bank (western) Ukraine was annexed by the Russian Empire. Over the years that followed, a policy known as Russification banned the use and study of the Ukrainian language, and people were pressured to convert to the Russian Orthodox faith.

Ukraine suffered some of its greatest traumas during the 20th century. After the communist revolution of 1917, Ukraine was one of the many countries to fight a brutal civil war before being fully absorbed into the Soviet Union in 1922. In the early 1930s, to force peasants to join collective farms, Soviet leader Joseph Stalin orchestrated a famine that resulted in the starvation and death of millions of Ukrainians. Afterward, Stalin imported large numbers of Russians and other Soviet citizens—many with no ability to speak Ukrainian and with few ties to the region—to help repopulate the east.

These legacies of history created lasting fault lines. Because eastern Ukraine came under Russian rule much earlier than western Ukraine, people in the east have stronger ties to Russia and have been more likely to support Russian-leaning leaders. Western Ukraine, by contrast, spent centuries under the shifting control of European powers such as Poland and the Austro-Hungarian Empire—one reason Ukrainians in the west have tended to support more Western-leaning politicians. The eastern population tends to be more Russian-speaking and Orthodox, while parts of the west are more Ukrainian-speaking and Catholic.

With the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Ukraine became an independent nation. But uniting the country proved a difficult task. For one, “the sense of Ukrainian nationalism is not as deep in the east as it is in west,” says former ambassador to Ukraine Steven Pifer. The transition to democracy and capitalism was painful and chaotic, and many Ukrainians, especially in the east, longed for the relative stability of earlier eras.

"The biggest divide after all these factors is between those who view the Russian imperial and Soviet rule more sympathetically versus those who see them as a tragedy," says Adrian Karatnycky, a Ukraine expert and former fellow at the Atlantic Council of the United States. These fissures were laid bare during the 2004 Orange Revolution, in which thousands of Ukrainians marched to support greater integration with Europe.

On ecological maps you can even see the divide between the southern and eastern parts of Ukraine—known as the steppes—with their fertile farming soil and the northern and western regions, which are more forested, says Serhii Plokhii, a history professor at Harvard and director of its Ukrainian Research Institute. He says a map depicting the demarcations between the steppe and the forest, a diagonal line between east and west, bears a "striking resemblance" to political maps of Ukrainian presidential elections in 2004 and 2010.

Crimea was occupied and annexed by Russia in 2014, followed shortly after by a separatist uprising in the eastern Ukrainian region of Donbas that resulted in the declaration of the Russian-backed People’s Republics of Luhansk and Donetsk. Today, the two countries find themselves in conflict yet again, fault lines that reflect the region's tumultuous history.

With powerful bronze rams and the ability to turn on a dime, it would leave enemy ships dead in the water by punching holes in their sides or smashing their oars. In his Histories, Herodotus writes how Greek naval dominance owed so much to the brilliant use of triremes in battle.

(This 3,500-year-old tomb held the treasures of Greece's 'Griffin Warrior'.)

In the fifth century B.C., Athenian shipyards had the capacity for over 300 triremes, the most famous warships of antiquity. The trireme—a term derived from the Greek trieres, “three rows of oars”—was the result of the continuous development of naval technology in the Greek world. The epic poem Iliad (attributed to Homer, and written in the eighth century B.C.) mentions ships called triaconters and penteconters, vessels that were crewed by 30 or 50 men, respectively. Biremes, with two rows of oarsmen, are recorded on eighth-century B.C. reliefs. At the beginning of the seventh century B.C., accumulated experience led to new technical advances, and the much more sophisticated trireme model appeared. Thucydides wrote that the Corinthians were the first to introduce the design to the Greek world, though modern historians think triremes may have first been built in Phoenicia, in the eastern Mediterranean and what is now Lebanon.

The Greeks considered triremes to be living things, each endowed with a sacred character. For this reason, the ships were given individual names, which were almost always feminine. Their characteristic eyes located on both sides of the prow were used to “find their way through the sea,” the walkways protruding from the prow were their “ears,” and the sails were their “wings.”

Captain and crew

Faster and more stable than their predecessors, triremes were expensive to produce. Manufacturing costs ran as high as more than one talent (6,000 drachmas, or 58 pounds of silver). If a ship were damaged in battle, it could still be put to good use. With proper maintenance, triremes could remain in service for 20 to 25 years before being decommissioned or sold as “war surplus.” History has recorded some that were sailing for more than 80 years.

The ships in the best shape were reserved for the military, while older ones were used mainly for surveillance and transportation. Athens had two prized triremes, the Salamina and the Paralo. Noted for their beauty, these flagships were often used for diplomatic missions or rituals, such as transporting Athenian athletes to the Olympic Games every four years.

The Athenian fleet boasted more than 50,000 oarsmen, few of whom were slaves or foreigners. Most of them belonged to the class of thetes, citizens of the wage-earning class who could not cover the cost of arming themselves, as soldiers were required to do. The development of the navy as a bulwark of Athenian democracy in the fifth century B.C. raised this social class’s influence in relation to the aristocracy. It is no coincidence that Greek philosophers like Plato and Euenus and Athenian citizens began to refer to their leaders as “helmsmen” who guided the “ship of state.”

Paying the crew was a considerable expense. Wages were about one talent per month, an expense paid by the captain (trierarchos) from his own pocket. Keeping the crew well fed was crucial to their performance. A typical diet included salted fish, oatcakes, wine, cheese, vegetables, and about seven quarts of water per day.

The fleet’s departure, commanded by one or more naval commander (strategoi), was an important event. Their training enabled the crew to get in position and check that the ship, their tools, and weapons were in good working order quickly: within just 30 seconds, according to a modern simulation. A priest officiated at an animal sacrifice before the captain offered a prayer and hymn to the gods. Finally, a cup of wine was poured over the ship’s bow and stern as a libation.

Under sail, the oarsmen followed the orders of the keleustés, issued by shouting or striking a piece of timber with a mace. When the roar of waves or battle prevented the rowing master from being heard, an aulos, a wind instrument like a double flute, marked the rowing beat. The oarsmen joined in with traditional chants to keep in time.

Triremes did not have much room on board for storage or sleeping, so the boats tended to sail only during the day. At night, the trireme was hauled out of the water, both to protect its hull from shipworms and to allow the crew to eat and rest. While ashore, the hull could also be checked for needed repairs.

Ramming speeds

The trireme’s most feared weapon was a bronze battering ram attached to the prow of the ship. Fierce ancient naval battles were fought by trying to slam into the side of an enemy ship and either puncture the hull or damage the oars to immobilize it. Scholars estimate the maximum ramming speed to be around nine knots (10.4 miles an hour).

A typical strategy was to ram an enemy ship and retreat quickly to let it sink. In the case of surrender (or when the attackers picked up the survivors before they drowned), captured oarsmen were allowed to change sides (experienced oarsmen were very valuable assets). If an attacking ship rammed a ship and became stuck in its side, each crew would be forced into combat with the goal of seizing the intact ship, while the vessel that had been rammed would be abandoned.

Dozens of triremes would return to Athens in early winter. If dolphins swam off their bows, it was a good omen, as these animals were believed to save sailors from drowning. Each trireme underwent repairs and cleaning in port. The trierarchs presented reports of their missions, while sailors and oarsmen collected their wages.

Triremes played a key role in the Greek victory. Pietro Canali/Fototeca 9x12 Naval battles not only happened above water; they could also be fought under the sea. From the ninth century B.C., Greek navies were hiring divers who were capable of staying underwater for long periods of time, a feat similar to that undertaken by free divers today. Scyllias of Scione and his daughter Hydna were two such celebrated swimmers.



Accounts of their heroism during Xerxes I’s Persian invasion of Greece in 480 B.C. have been found in several accounts. Scyllias and Hydna are credited with scuttling the Persian vessels during this conflict. During a savage storm, they dove under the anchored Persian ships, cutting the ropes binding them to the anchors. The ships began to drift uncontrollably toward the storm and were destroyed. Both Scyllias and Hydna were heroes to the victorious Greeks, who later dedicated statues to them at Delphi, the Greek world’s most sacred place. Writing in the late fifth century B.C., Greek historian Herodotus wrote a slightly different version. In his telling, Scyllias was a diver for Xerxes who defected to the Greek side, swimming some eight nautical miles (allegedly using a reed as a kind of snorkel) to reach the Greeks and inform them of weaknesses in the Persian navy. Greek forces capitalized on the information and soundly defeated the Persians​.

Reinvention and resurgence

Greece’s naval dominance did not last forever, and the trireme evolved. Modifications to the trireme as a design were spearheaded by various Mediterranean powers, and put to the test in the period when the successors of Alexander the Great fought for dominance in the late fourth and early third centuries B.C. By the time of the First Punic War in the mid-third century B.C., Romans and Carthaginians were fighting at sea using quadriremes and quinqueremes.

When the Romans conquered Macedonia in 168 B.C., they were surprised to discover an ancient trireme, left abandoned in a shipyard for 70 years. They considered it a relic, but so beautifully made that they reused it. History’s final recorded battle relying on the descendants of the trireme was the Battle of Lepanto off western Greece on October 7, 1571—more than 2,000 years after triremes first sailed. The Holy League coalition of Spain and many Italian city-states smashed the Ottoman fleet, killing nearly half their 67,000 men.

The Battle of Lepanto was one of the last naval conflicts in the West to rely heavily on human-driven galleys; subsequent naval conflicts would be dominated by sail-powered craft. The vast deployment of craft that marked naval battles in antiquity was also becoming a thing of the past. Nearly 700 galleys took part in the Battle of Ecnomus between Rome and Carthage in 256 B.C. A total of around 70 vessels took part in the Battle of Trafalgar of 1805.

(At the Battle of Marathon, Athens' underdog victory stunned Persia.)

Today archaeologists are keen to find any material remains of fifth-century B.C. triremes throughout the Mediterranean world. Because the ships were made of soft wood and susceptible to shipworms and decay, well-preserved wrecks are difficult, if not impossible, to find in the warm seawaters.

Team efforts Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited. Naval massacre When a ship was sunk by the enemy, the soldiers who fell into the water risked being drowned or killed with arrows from the enemy ships, as happened at Salamis in 480 B.C.​ Prisma/Album In 1987 a team led by naval architect John Coates and Cambridge University professor John S. Morrison built the Olympias, a reproduction of a classic Athenian trireme. The ship plied the Mediterranean, living up to her name. But her 170 oarsmen were only able to power the boat at a maximum speed of nine knots (10.4 miles an hour) for five minutes. Coordinating the crew was extremely difficult, even for professionals. Moreover, when the Olympias faced headwinds with gusts of up to 25 knots (28.8 mph), the oarsmen on the lowest banks, the thalamites, struggled to keep rowing in rough surf and huge waves. The other oarsmen not only had trouble rowing in rhythm but also were physically exhausted after an hour. No doubt the preparation, training, and years of experience shared by trireme oarsmen of ancient Greece were far superior to the brief training of these modern sailors. The strenuous efforts of the modern sailors gives some idea of the incredible effort the Greeks were capable of exerting for hours on end at the height of battle. The Greek navy needed to be able to count on thousands of such sailors, which explains why their extraordinary strength, ferocity, and loyalty was well rewarded. They received comparatively high wages and a social status that reflected their importance in ancient Athens.​

The bronze rams, however, would survive centuries at the bottom of the sea, and archaeologists continue to comb the waters for them. One of the first and most significant discoveries was the so-called Athlit ram, discovered in 1980 near the village of Athlit, Israel. Giving great insight into how these weapons were forged, the heavy bronze ram weighs more than 1,000 pounds. It was found with timbers still attached from what is now believed to be a trireme or quadrireme from around the second century B.C.

One of the most valuable archaeological sites is the military port of Piraeus. Located about five miles from Athens, Piraeus was home to the mighty Athenian fleet at the height of its powers in the fifth century B.C. Archaeologists were thrilled to find the remains of several ancient boathouses (neosoikoi), which helped them better understand not only how triremes were built but also how they were maintained. The hunt continues for these former boats that ruled the Mediterranean and what they can reveal about the shipbuilding culture of ancient Athens.the past and all that is in it

While her siblings were placed on thrones all over Europe, Pauline was quoted as saying: “I do not care for crowns. If I had wished for one, I should have had it; but I left that taste to my relations.”

(Was Napoleon Bonaparte an enlightened leader or tyrant?)

Born in Ajaccio, Corsica, on October 20, 1780, she was the sixth of the eight children of lawyer Charles-Marie Bonaparte and Maria Letizia Ramolino. Pauline opted for a life of amorous adventure rather than reshaping the political map of Europe. She used her beauty and boldness to conquer a long train of lovers and, despite scandals, won the admiration of the European beau monde as an icon of style.

“Few women have savored more the pleasure of being beautiful,” the French general Louis Stanislas de Girardin wrote of her. For Napoleon himself, she was “the best living creature” and “the only one who never asks for anything.” Though often frivolous and feckless, Pauline had a loyal and courageous side too. She was the only one of his siblings to visit Napoleon (and to help him financially) when he was exiled to the island of Elba in 1814 after his failed military campaign in Russia. During his second banishment, to St. Helena, after his defeat at Waterloo, Pauline even requested to spend time with him on the remote island in the southern Atlantic.

(Napoleon lost the Battle of Waterloo—here’s what went wrong.)

Pauline ... was then in the full brilliance of her beauty ... Few women have savored more the pleasure of being beautiful.



Family fortunes

Despite the death of her father when she was five, Pauline grew up in the bosom of a comfortable family until her early teens. Then, in 1793, times got harder: Her brother Lucien became embroiled in a political controversy, forcing the family to flee Corsica for the French mainland. Once in Marseille, they lived in straitened circumstances. That same year, Napoleon first made his name militarily, starting an ascent that would vastly improve his family’s fortunes.

Pauline never had the formal education that women of high social standing were expected to have to secure a wealthy husband. At age 15, her beauty was enough to catch the eye of her brother’s military comrades. After a dalliance or two, she fell for the veteran French revolutionary Stanislas Fréron. Entangled with another mistress (and 26 years Pauline’s senior), he was rejected by her mother. No end of suitors appeared. Napoleon told one aspirant, “You have nothing. She has nothing. What does that total? Nothing.” In the end, her brother persuaded her to consider Charles Leclerc. They married in 1797, and a year later the couple’s only son, Dermide, was born.

Wife, widow, princess

In 1801, to quell an ongoing revolution in Saint-Domingue (in what is Haiti today) and protect France’s sugar income from its colony, Napoleon (now first consul) sent Pauline’s husband to the Caribbean to lead 23,000 French soldiers. Pauline and her son followed in 1802. Leclerc achieved initial victories against the rebels, led by Toussaint L’ouverture.

(The Christmas Eve plot to blow up Napoleon.)

Leclerc’s successes were short-lived. Renewed fighting coincided with an outbreak of yellow fever that began to decimate the French troops. Amid declining morale, Pauline provided social diversion, with herself at the center, by hosting balls and fetes. She also turned the family’s mansion into a field hospital. Leclerc urged his wife to return to France, but she refused. Leclerc wrote to Napoleon that she chose to follow her husband’s fortunes for “good or ill.” In November 1802, Leclerc died from yellow fever, and Pauline and her son returned to France.

While genuinely grieving her husband’s death, Pauline soon took up romantic liaisons. Her love life would always generate gossip, but it was frequently seized on and exaggerated by Napoleon’s royalist enemies. "Pauline was often singled out by Bourbon sympathizers as a nymphomaniac who cared not whether her partner or partners were men or women, or, when in Haiti with Leclerc, whether they were his officers or Haitians who opposed the French Army,” says Flora Fraser, author of Pauline Bonaparte: Venus of Empire. “The object was always to damage, by extension, her brother’s reputation.”

Napoleon had his sights set on imperial power and knew that his reputation must be beyond reproach. His sister’s image was bound closely to his, and so, once again, he sought out a new husband for Pauline: The very rich, well-connected Prince Camillo Borghese, whose presence in the family would help Napoleon reinforce ties with French-occupied Italy. They married in June 1803.

Initially, Pauline approved of the 28-year-old prince’s Mediterranean good looks, not to mention the title of princess, a generous annuity, property, and the use of the celebrated Borghese jewels. But Pauline soon grew disillusioned, and the marriage deteriorated. Among other gibes, she took to calling him “His Serene Idiot.”

Pauline’s health had begun to trouble her. In 1804, Prince Borghese took Pauline to the baths of Pisa to recover, but he didn’t allow her to bring along her son. While she was away, the six-year-old contracted a fever and died. Pauline blamed the prince. Their ill-suited match now ruptured, she persuaded Napoleon to allow her to return to Paris, rather than to Rome with Prince Borghese. Despising her husband, she once again took refuge in love affairs.

Immortal beauty

Shortly after their marriage, Borghese had commissioned Antonio Canova, the greatest neoclassical sculptor of the time, to portray his new wife. The artist wanted a mythological theme, suggesting Diana, the Roman virgin goddess of hunting.

Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.

Pauline laughed at such an incongruous idea, opting for Venus, the Roman goddess of love. Titled “Venus Victrix” (“Venus Victorious”), the resulting masterpiece has endured as Pauline’s greatest claim to fame. By having herself depicted as Venus, Pauline’s innate vanity could not be more evident. But, as Fraser notes, it also showed her “disregard for convention, and even an enjoyment in breaking with convention.”

Pauline’s decision to pose nude was notorious at the time for a woman of her station, but the sculpture’s technical virtuosity won widespread admiration when it was completed in 1808. Seen at night by torchlight, as Canova recommended, the figure’s smoothly polished marble seemed like real flesh. Today Pauline’s form continues to amaze visitors to the Galleria Borghese in Rome.

(How Beethoven went from Napoleon’s biggest fan to his worst critic.)

Napoleon seemed to ignore most of Pauline’s unconventional behavior. This choice contrasts with the man who, when named emperor of France in 1804, emphasized “good morals” and restricted the rights women had gained during the French Revolution. For Napoleon, empire was one thing and family another—and no one exemplified that contrast more than his sister.

Loyal to the last

Pauline’s health problems worsened over the years. She experienced chronic abdominal pain and traveled from spa to spa in search of relief or a cure. She often insisted on being carried in a litter to avoid walking. Her demands became increasingly capricious. She bid her attendants to act as footstools or to lay down their cloaks on the ground so she could rest.

When Napoleon was forced into exile on St. Helena in 1815, Pauline returned to Rome, where she lobbied the British authorities to set her brother free. Five years later, as reports came of Napoleon’s decline, she repeatedly asked for permission to join him and “be there when he breathes his last.” He died in 1821 while she was still awaiting a response.

("The Death of Napoleon" captures the end of a tumultuous era.)

Her own health was gradually broken by what is believed to be stomach cancer. In 1825, 20 years after separating from her husband, Pauline returned to live with him in Palazzo Borghese. It was there that she died three months later.the past and all that is in it

On March 8, 1910—113 years ago today—Raymonde de Laroche, a former Parisian stage actress, became the first licensed female pilot in the world. Nine years later she was killed when the experimental aircraft she was flying dove into the ground.

Harriet Quimby, a well-known journalist, became the first American woman to obtain a pilot’s license in 1911. She died a year later when her new plane pitched her into Boston Harbor.

In 1921, Bessie Coleman was the first Black woman to receive a pilot’s license—she had to travel to France to find a flight school that would teach her. But five years later she was killed when a wrench got caught in her plane’s controls, sending the plane plummeting.

Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.

Flying was perilous in aviation’s earliest days. The planes were “flimsy contraptions fashioned from bamboo, wire, and fabric,” according to the late historian Eileen Lebow. They didn’t have seat belts or even a roof to hold the pilot should the aircraft flip over. Yet women like Laroche, Quimby, and Coleman were willing to risk their lives for the freedom that flights promised.

“Aviation was a new profession seemingly free from the gender expectations and sex typing that limited women elsewhere,” noted historian Susan Ware at the National Air and Space Museum’s inaugural Amelia Earhart Lecture in Aviation History in 2022. “Women were getting in at the beginning.”

For many of them the thrill of flying was intoxicating but so was the opportunity to be assessed on their own merits. “These women wanted to be judged as human beings rather than as women,” says Ware.

(Women could fly before they could vote.)

Coleman especially saw flight as a path toward broader gender and racial equality. "I knew we had no aviators, neither men nor women, and I knew the Race needed to be represented along this most important line,” she said shortly after she returned to the United States from France in 1921. “I thought it my duty to risk my life to learn aviating and to encourage flying among men and women of the Race who are so far behind.” Before she died, she’d planned to open a flight school that would welcome African American aviators.

Many early women fliers shared the dream that achievement in this field would lead to more independence. As one journalist and amateur pilot wrote in 1930, “A woman who can find fulfillment in the skies will never again need to live her life in some man’s spare moments.”

Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.

Some of that independence would come from the ease of travel that aviation promised in its earliest incarnation. Many people, including Amelia Earhart, believed at first that airplanes would become as commonly owned by families as bicycles and automobiles already had.

(Flight attendants had to fight for their rights.)

Other women embraced the financial independence that they thought the new field would offer. Neta Snook, whose first solo flight was in a plane she rebuilt, made her living by offering up her plane for aerial advertising, test flying experimental aircraft, taking paying passengers up for aerial tours, and teaching beginning fliers, including Earhart. Gladys Roy, on the other hand, earned good money as a stunt pilot, dancing the Charleston and playing tennis on the wings midflight for amazed crowds at air shows. (Snook retired from aviation when she became pregnant in her mid-twenties and lived to be 95; Roy died at 25 when she accidentally stepped into a propeller.)

Sisters Katherine and Marjorie Stinson took a more long-term approach, establishing a flight school in Texas with their mother and brother that trained, among others, Canadian pilots in the run up to World War I. When the U.S. entered the war, the country’s civil aviation—including the Stinson School for Flying—was shut down. Katherine went to Europe to serve as an ambulance driver while Marjorie became an aeronautical draftsman for the Navy.

War and the development of commercial aviation conspired to dampen women’s hopes of equality in the air. Experienced women pilots such as LaRoche and Katherine Stinson volunteered to serve in their countries’ nascent air forces during World War I. They were denied, the military preferring to train unseasoned men. The same pattern occurred in World War II, although Women’s Airforce Service Pilots (WASPs) did ferry U.S. military planes as civilian pilots during the conflict. (The Soviet Union, however, had three female air combat regiments.)

Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.

The dream of every family owning a private plane never did materialize; the infrastructure required would have been too extensive. Instead, the commercial aviation industry developed, hiring men—many of whom had been trained as pilots by the military. It was no use pointing out, as Earhart did, that if women "had access to the training and equipment men had we could certainly do as well."

Helen Richey became the first female commercial pilot in 1934 but was hounded out of her job. The U.S. Commerce Department, under pressure from the all-male pilots’ union, decreed that women weren’t allowed to fly scheduled routes in bad weather (they’d previously considered “grounding female pilots for nine days a month during menstruation,” according to Ware).

There wouldn’t be another female commercial pilot until 1973, when Emily Howell Warner was hired by Frontier.European pirates cruised the coasts of North America, western Africa, and South America during the so-called golden age of piracy, the period of heightened piratical activity in the Atlantic Ocean between 1650 and 1730. And many pirates like Blackbeard and Captain Kidd rose to notoriety in part due to their Caribbean exploits during that time. But in the late 17th and early 18th centuries, some pirates shifted their geographical focus to the Indian Ocean, along Africa’s eastern coast, lured by treasure-laden ships carrying gold, silver, and gems. Their malevolent deeds created a less famous focus of piracy’s golden era, which continues to some extent today. Who were these pirates and how exactly did this lesser known aspect of piracy transpire?

(Where did pirates spend their booty?)

The allure of wealth

By the 1690s, the Indian Ocean teemed with merchant vessels that routinely carried valuable cargoes. Convoys frequently transported wealthy Muslim pilgrims and luxury goods like silks and spices between the Mughal Empire (including present-day India) and Mecca. There were also the treasures carried by the East India Companies of England, France, and the Netherlands; ships headed east transported cash to finance operations in the region, while those returning west contained fine silks, jewels, and spices they had accumulated. The most coveted treasure ships, though, belonged to the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb, who ruled his South Asian empire between 1658 until his death in 1707.

(Pirates once swashbuckled across the ancient Mediterranean.)

Pirates eyed these prospects of enormous wealth—gold, silver, and gems were much more profitable than the Caribbean’s timber, rum, and cloth—and flocked east in droves.

Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.

Arrival at St. Mary’s

As pirates arrived, they needed a safe harbor to refit their ships and escape storms, as well as a place to enjoy their loot. That place became Madagascar, 250 miles off the African coast, with St. Mary’s Island off its remote northeast coast being the most famous stronghold. The Indigenous Malagasy had until then successfully warded off Europeans eyeing the island’s strategic location along major shipping channels between Europe and Asia.

(On the trail of Ireland’s legendary pirate queen.)

Then along came English “trader” Adam Baldridge. Wanted for murder in British Jamaica, he fled to St. Mary’s Island, subdued the locals (no doubt through vicious means), and set up a pirate haven in 1691. He established an illicit business with a New York merchant in which he traded pirates’ booty for European wares such as tobacco and food, providing a thriving economic network to support the pirates’ way of life.

Baldridge built an incredibly fortified bastion on St. Mary’s, which allowed more than a thousand pirates hide out there in the 1690s, enjoying the good life of rum, women, and safety in between looting raids.

Pirate success stories

Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.

Two of most successful European pirates in the Indian Ocean were the English pirate John Taylor and his French counterpart, Olivier Levasseur, also known as La Buse, who worked together in 1721 to attack the Nossa Senhora de Cabo. The ship, carrying important passengers including the archbishop of Goa and count of Ericeira, Viceroy of Portuguese India—along with diamonds valued at 500,000 British pounds and rare Asian silks and porcelain worth 375,000 British pounds—had been damaged at sea and was docked at the East African island of Reunion for repairs. The men easily seized the vessel and made away with booty worth more than 900,000 British pounds. Tales like this encouraged pirates to troll the Indian Ocean, looking for vessels to plunder.

Another hugely successful pirate was Henry Avery. The Englishman got his start as a member of a merchant ship before becoming first mate on the privateering ship Charles II, employed by the king of Spain. Aboard the Charles II, Avery convinced the other men to commit mutiny and make away with the ship. The mutiny was met with great success, after which Avery indicated he was turning to piracy: “I am bound to Madagascar, with a Design of making my own Fortune,” he stated. He renamed the ship Fancy, customized it to be speedier under sail, and headed east. Known as the king of the pirates, Avery operated for only a couple of years, though he spearheaded perhaps piracy’s most lucrative raid.

(Pirate portrayals—from Blackbeard to Captain Kidd—are more fantasy than fact.)

Illustration via Buyenlarge Archive, UIG / Bridgeman Images Not all fortune-seeking pirates in the Indian Ocean, however, were victorious. Take Dutch pirate Dirk Chivers, for example. He is infamous for holding four ships hostage in the harbor at Calicut, Kerala, in southern India. He demanded 10,000 British pounds from the Indian governor and East India Company, who countered with 5,000 British pounds. Offended by the offer, Chivers raised the “bloody colors”—a red flag that meant certain death. He set one of the hostage ships on fire, and a compromise was offered, 40,000 rupees. This time, Chivers agreed to take it, but when the money failed to show, he burned a second ship.



What Chivers failed to realize was that the Indian government and the East India Company were working on another plot. They had messaged pirates in India to attack Chivers and his men, which forced them to flee the harbor. They’d have to find their riches elsewhere.

Piracy’s greatest heist

In July 1695, word spread that the Grand Mughal of India’s treasure fleet was returning from its annual pilgrimage to Mecca. Henry Avery joined forces with other pirates, including Thomas Tew, a Rhode Islander privateer-turned-pirate. They waited several weeks before their big prizes approached: the Fateh Muhammed and the Ganj-i-Sawai. The pirates first attacked the Fateh Muhammed, the flagship’s escort. There wasn’t much of a fight, and the pirates hauled 50,000 to 60,000 British pounds—but the pirates wanted more. Avery then went after the flagship, the mighty Ganj-i-Sawai, equipped with 62 cannon and hundreds of musketeers. A bloody battle ensued, with the frightened captain finally seeking cover below decks and the remaining Indians surrendering. The haul from the Ganj-i-Sawai was hundreds of thousands of pounds in gold, silver, and jewels, worth tens of millions of dollars today—perhaps piracy’s richest haul ever.

Alas, it didn’t turn out very well for Tew and his crew. Tew died during the battle for the ships, and Avery refused to share more than just a small amount of the plunder with the other pirates. Such was the pirate’s life.

End of an era

By the end of the 18th century, as Europeans began colonizing throughout the Indian Ocean region, the area became difficult for pirates to operate in, but they never truly disappeared. Examples of piracy in the Indian Ocean exist well into the 21st century, particularly off the coast of Somalia.

How certain foods lower your risk of diseaseWhen limestone quarry workers in Germany’s Neander Valley discovered fossilized bones in 1856, they thought they’d uncovered the remains of a bear. In fact, they’d stumbled upon something that would change history: evidence of an extinct species of ancient human predecessors who walked the Earth between at least 400,000 and 40,000 years ago.

Researchers soon realized that they had already encountered these human relatives in earlier fossils that had been found, and misidentified, throughout the early 19th century. The discovery galvanized scientists eager to explore new theories of evolution, sparking a worldwide fossil hunt and tantalizing the public with the possibility of a mysterious sister species that once dominated Europe.

Now known as Neanderthals—so named by geologist William King—Homo neanderthalensis are humans’ closest known relatives. Here’s what to know about our human ancestors, including how they lived and why they died out.

Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.

What is a Neanderthal?

At first glance, fossilized Neanderthal bones seem human-like. But a closer look reveals the characteristics that differentiate our ancient ancestors from modern Homo sapiens.

Neanderthals looked similar to humans but had more prominent brows, protruding faces, and rib cages that were shorter, deeper, and wider. In addition, their eye sockets were much larger, though it is unclear if their vision differed from ours. Researchers believe that Neanderthal brains were roughly the same size as ours, although they were more elongated. Though debates on the size and structures of Neanderthal brains still rage today, researchers agree that the average male Neanderthal was about 5 foot 4 inches tall, while females stood at about 5 feet.

(You may have more Neanderthal DNA than you think.)

These hominids once lived throughout Eurasia. Researchers believe that due to the species’ adaptation to the region’s cold climates, Neanderthals had compact, massive musculature and would have required up to 4,480 calories a day to survive.

Megafauna like mammoths, elephants, and woolly rhinoceros made hunting an important facet of Neanderthal life. Living and traveling in small groups, they used tools like spears to satiate their meat-heavy diet. They also ate plants—which MIT geobiologist Ainara Sistiaga has said is evidence that Neanderthals “probably ate what was available in different situations, seasons and climates.”

Sometimes, this included eating their own: In 2016, scientists studying Neanderthal remains from a cave in what is now Belgium found “unambiguous evidence of Neanderthal cannibalism in Northern Europe.”

Were Neanderthals intelligent?

Researchers initially assumed Neanderthals were brutish, hairy thugs capable only of crude thought and bloody hunting. But some scientists have changed their tune as evidence has accumulated of some surprisingly human-like characteristics among these human ancestors.

Neanderthals used tools in domestic and hunting contexts, flaking rocks to create weapons, scrapers, and axes. Woodworking was also common—they cut and whittled sticks they used to dig or form spears.

Despite their assumed ability to withstand the cold, Neanderthals are also thought to have processed animal hides and crafted clothing that could cover up to 80 percent of their bodies. Like humans, they are thought to have covered their feet and other sensitive body parts, but since the clothing has long since disintegrated, researchers can only infer how Neanderthals may have dressed.

Another breakthrough was the discovery that Neanderthals may have been capable of symbolic thought. A few archaeological sites have yielded decorated eagle talons and objects thought to have been used in burial rituals—evidence, some say, of advanced thought and tradition. Then, in 2018, researchers announced they’d discovered evidence of cave paintings from 65,000 years ago—the oldest artworks of their kind. But the abstract nature of this art continues to fuel debates among scientists about how complex their mental capacities truly were.

When and why did Neanderthals go extinct?

Whatever their cognitive abilities, Neanderthals were ultimately doomed. However, their extinction is just as contentious as other facets of their lives, and scientists still debate what caused them to disappear around 40,000 years ago.

(Ancient DNA reveals new twists in Neanderthal migration.)

Researchers know that in at least some cases, Neanderthals coexisted and even mated with Homo sapiens, which emerged in Africa about 300,000 years ago. But Homo sapiens eventually won out genetically, and the vast majority of modern humans' genes come from our African ancestors. Some surmise that competition from humans for food and shelter, or evolution that selected for more successful human traits, contributed to the Neanderthals’ extinction. Others think that because Neanderthals lived in such small groups, they simply became outnumbered by humans.

Another hypothesis involves climate change: Scientists have documented a thousand-year-long cold snap in central Europe that coincided with the Neanderthals’ extinction about 40,000 years ago and that could have depopulated the species. Cooling is thought to have been less severe in areas populated by Homo sapiens, and those who embrace this theory believe that once Neanderthal populations declined, humans moved in and eventually became the dominant species worldwide.

Still another theory involves weapons: Perhaps early humans had better weapons and simply outbattled the Neanderthals.

Modern humans and Neanderthal DNA

Despite their species’ demise, fascinating remnants of Neanderthals can be found in the genetic material of some modern humans. Up to 4 percent of the DNA of humans living outside of Africa, the cradle of Homo sapiens, can be traced back to Neanderthals. That overlap shows that Neanderthals did interbreed with humans.

(How do Neanderthal genes affect your health?)

“Ironically,” write prehistory experts Peter C. Kjærgaard, Mark Maslin, and Trine Kellberg Nielsen, “with a current world population of about 8 billion people, this means that there has never been more Neanderthal DNA on Earth.”

Given how long it’s been since Neanderthals roamed Eurasia, it’s impossible to truly reconstruct how they lived and died. But the mystery of these human ancestors—and tantalizing hints that they were much like us—continues to drive research, and controversy, to this day.

Editor's note: This article has been updated to clarify how Neanderthal faces and bodies differed from modern humans. A reference to Neanderthal DNA in modern humans has also been revised to specify that the DNA was found in humans living outside of Africa.One of the greatest villains of the Roman Empire is the empress Messalina. The third wife of the emperor Claudius, she is remembered today as the most promiscuous woman in Rome, the nymphomaniac empress. The Messalina in the modern imagination is a pinnacle of uncontrolled, violent, irrational, and impulsive behavior. Her sexual appetite is unrivaled, and her motivations quite wicked. When Mikhail Bulgakov was filling Satan’s ball in The Master and Margarita, he included Messalina as a guest. When Charlotte Bronte needed to describe the mad wife in the attic in Jane Eyre, Bronte likened her to a German vampire as well as Messalina. Of all the scandalous women who violated Roman gender roles, Messalina has come down through history as the most scandalous of all.

Noble beginnings

Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.

Valeria Messalina was at most 18 in A.D. 38 when she married her only husband, Tiberius Claudius Nero Germanicus. Claudius on the other hand was a 47-year-old, twice-divorced, father of two. The pair were first cousins once removed, both descended from the Divine Augustus’s sister Octavia.

The marriage was a great honor for Claudius, as his previous wives had been of moderate prestige compared to Messalina. His marriage to a descendant of Octavia coincided with his belated entry into public life and was a sign that the new emperor—his nephew Caligula—approved of him and was tying him closely to the line of succession.

(Caligula thought he was a god, and it got him killed.)

For Messalina, however, the marriage was likely less thrilling. Her new husband had spent his entire life until this point as a family embarrassment. He had visible disabilities that allegedly prompted his mother to refer to him as a monster, his great-uncle Augustus to forbid him from sitting with the rest of the family in public, and his uncle Tiberius to banish him from any public office. Imperial Rome was an unfriendly place for disabled people, and no one knew that better than Claudius. He had seen his siblings receive glorious honors and advantageous marriages. Claudius had no prestige and brought little but his bloodline to enhance Messalina’s own. It is hard to imagine that she looked forward to marriage to a man 30 years her senior whose achievements she could not even brag about.

The pair had two children in quick succession, and Claudius unexpectedly—and controversially—became emperor. After Caligula was assassinated in A.D. 41, Claudius took refuge in the army camps and haggled for two days to convince the Senate to accept him as emperor.

Messalina’s husband, with no experience and little promise, had surpassed everyone’s expectations when he took power. Still in her early 20s and prepared for a life of aristocratic leisure, Messalina had become an empress. Just weeks after her husband ascended to the Roman throne, she made history by being the first woman to give birth to a Roman emperor’s son.

Lineage was a key factor in the match between Claudius and Messalina. The 30-year age gap and general incompatibility between them were overlooked in favor of their heritage. The pair’s marriage formed one of the “purest” connections to the Julio-Claudian dynasty, in that it descended directly from Octavia, sister of Augustus. Tiberius, Caligula, and Claudius all descended from Livia, Augustus’s third wife, and were thereby linked also to the Claudian line​.

Messalina's reputation

Most information on Messalina’s relationship with Claudius comes from the first and second-century A.D. historians Tacitus and Suetonius, each writing decades after her death during a time critical of Rome’s early emperors. Suetonius writes of the pair in The Twelve Caesars, but his descriptions are short and matter-of-fact. Tacitus has much more to say on the subject.

Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.

Messalina’s first years as Claudius’s wife and empress were not included in these works, so it is unclear if her notoriety was present from the start of her husband’s rule. Roman men tended to perceive women as being constitutionally corrupt, unlike men, who became corrupted. Roman law viewed women as perpetual minors and distrusted them to control their own property.

(Claudius's next wife, Agrippina, was a master strategist. She paid the price for it.)

It is possible that opinions of Messalina changed over time, but when Tacitus’s narrative picks up around A.D. 47, six years into Claudius’s reign, the historian thinks Messalina’s a monster. Tacitus’s first mention of the empress describes her manipulating her husband to punish two of her personal enemies: Valerius Asiaticus and Poppaea Sabina. Asiaticus owned the lovely Gardens of Lucullus, which Messalina coveted. She spread rumors of an extramarital affair between Asiaticus and Poppaea (who had taken a lover Messalina desired for herself). Claudius had the pair arrested and Asiaticus killed. Poppaea was imprisoned, and Tacitus reports she died by suicide after repeated harassment from Messalina’s agents.

In Tacitus’s telling, Messalina frequently uses the judicial system and the functions of the state for her own selfish ends. Through them, she obtains revenge on those who cross her, reject her sexual advances, or spark her envy. She exiles relatives and executes rivals. She lies about omens and circulates rumors to scare her husband into doing her bidding. She makes the personal political.

Marriage and betrayal

Messalina’s actions ultimately brought her down. Roman historians reported her undoing and subsequent murder with glee and snickering delight. Tacitus is again the chief source of information on Messalina’s final scandal. Other authors retold Messalina’s story, including the Roman poet Juvenal who wrote a scathing condemnation of her in his Satires, composed in the late first or early second century A.D. Writing a century later, Roman historian Cassius Dio continued the tradition of rendering Messalina as a villain, calling her “the most abandoned and lustful of women.”

Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.

The episode begins in A.D. 48, when Messalina starts a love affair with Senator Gaius Silius. Silius’s complicity varies across sources; in Juvenal and Dio he is a passive victim of her dominance, while in Tacitus he is an enthusiastic participant. Messalina lavishes him with decadent gifts, from family heirlooms to houses. Their affair proceeds until it becomes public knowledge. Silius divorces his wife, but Messalina cannot free herself from her emperor husband.

(Inside the conspiracy to kill Julius Caesar.)

The adulterers then do something so unexpected—so open and shocking—that even the ancient sources can barely believe it. The couple hold their own wedding while Claudius is out of town in Ostia. Messalina dons the yellow veil of a bride and proceeds publicly through the streets to Silius’s home, where they exchange vows. They then throw a raucous party that includes, according to Tacitus, Messalina wantonly letting her hair down.

The actual events and meaning of that day are still debated by modern historians. Was this a real wedding or a performance? Was it an attempted coup rather than a brazen affront? Some characterize the day as an attempt to overthrow Claudius, motivated entirely by political ambition to rule. The truth will never be known because neither conspirator survived the night.

Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.

Rumors of their wedding party, whether real or staged, reach Claudius in Ostia very quickly. To break the news, his administrators send his two favorite mistresses to tell him that his wife has publicly divorced him by marrying another man. Claudius, in Tacitus’s telling, panics, believing that Messalina and Silius are attempting to overthrow him. Claudius has them immediately arrested. Guards escort Messalina to the Gardens of Lucullus, and Silius is brought before Claudius at the army camps. Silius and his allies are executed on the spot for treason, and then Silius’s name vanishes from history.

Death of an empress

Claudius procrastinates over Messalina’s fate. She is his wife of a decade, the mother of his children, and a woman he loves by all accounts. He softens and decides to give her a hearing the next day. Claudius’s supporters fear that Messalina will escape punishment, so they take matters into their own hands. They falsely tell Roman centurions and a tribune to go to the gardens and execute Messalina on the orders of the emperor.

(The love child of Cleopatra and Julius Caesar was Egypt's last pharaoh.)

Messalina is in the gardens with her mother. Tacitus reports that even when she is trapped, Messalina does not give up. She tries to find a way out of the situation, but to no avail. When the soldiers arrive, they give her the option to kill herself, but she is unable to do it. Tacitus sneers that she was so lacking in virtue that she couldn’t even take her own life. One of the tribunes runs her through and ends her life.

Tacitus reported that Claudius is unmoved at the news of his wife’s death: “[H]e called for a cup and went through the routine of the banquet. Even in the days that followed, he betrayed no symptoms of hatred or of joy, of anger or of sadness, or, in fine, of any human emotion.” The Roman government decrees a damnatio memoriae against Messalina, striking her name from public and private places and destroying her statues. But this official erasure did not cause Messalina to fade from memory. Rather, her sexual appetites and bigamous wedding gave rise to rumors, jokes, and gossip that would overtake her every other action in the historical imagination, including her political machinations.

Erasing the past Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited. The Picture Art Collection/Alamy Romans who lived exemplary lives could be pronounced gods after death, but villains faced the postmortem punishment of damnatio memoriae, of having one’s name erased from history. If the government declared it, one’s name would be struck from public and private records, property seized, and portraits defaced. Caligula and Nero were two early emperors who were damned. Roman women could also be condemned; most were sentenced along with their husbands. Only a few, such as Messalina and Julia the Elder (daughter of Augustus Caesar), received their own condemnation outright. The practice continued into later eras. In the early 200s, Emperor Caracalla condemned his brother Geta after murdering him. Portraits of Geta, even as a boy like this one, were defaced, and it became a crime to say his name.

Rumors and innuendo

These jokes and whispers started early. Pliny the Elder, who was a young army officer serving in Germany during Claudius’s early rule, wrote an encyclopedia of natural phenomena, in which he included musings on mammalian sexuality. Humans, he notes, are the only animals who don’t have breeding seasons and who are never sated when it comes to sex. As an illustration, he tells the reader about Empress Messalina, who engaged in a competition with a sex worker to see who could take the most lovers. After 25 “embraces,” Messalina won.

A generation later, the anecdote grew even more outrageous when it was related by noted misanthrope Juvenal in his Satires. Messalina appears in the section on why he hates women. Calling her the “Imperial Whore,” Juvenal claims that every night Messalina disguised herself in a blonde wig—a hair color associated with barbarians—and worked at a low-class brothel, where she would have sex until the sun came up. She would be sent away “exhausted but not yet satisfied.”

Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.

By A.D. 220, when Cassius Dio was writing his Roman History, Messalina’s imagined brothel has moved into the imperial palace, where she invites men to buy sex from her and from other aristocratic women, some of whom are forced by Messalina into sex work. Dio also related a tale concerning a dancer, Mnester, who finds himself the focus of Messalina’s unwelcome advances. He rejects her repeatedly until Messalina complains to her husband that Mnester will not obey her, pretending that he is merely insubordinate. Claudius, none the wiser, orders Mnester to do whatever his wife commands, and thus Mnester must submit. This scene seems ripped directly from Greek and Roman comedy: The cuckolded husband and the unfaithful, sexually rapacious wife are stock characters. The story shows that Messalina’s real fall was so dramatic that anything could be said about her and be believed.

(Inside the decadent love affair of Cleopatra and Mark Antony.)

These kinds of stories delegitimize Messalina and reveal how Roman (and modern) misogyny works. In the sources that purport to be telling history—Tacitus, Suetonius, and Dio—Messalina is promiscuous but also clever, calculating, and cruel. She schemes with allies both within her household and the Senate to concoct plans and accumulate power. She uses the law courts and alliances to torment her enemies, and she runs a citywide network of spies and informers. She gathers information and deploys it to control her husband and thus control an empire. All these things are undoubtedly nefarious, but they demonstrate a certain respect for Messalina as a complete person.

Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.

The popular imagination has not dwelled on these aspects. Writers from Pliny and Juvenal to Bronte and Chuck Palahniuk employ Messalina only to highlight her lascivious nature. She is not a political operator but merely a wanton woman operating in the shadows of the bedroom. Sex scandals remove her from the masculine, public sphere of power and politics and place her back where women belong: in the domestic, private sphere of wife and mother. Her sharper edges soften when she is diminished into the simplest category of female villain: a woman who enjoys sex a lot.

Messalina’s true scandals were that she overstepped the defined boundaries of an empress’s appropriate place and engaged too openly in the cruel politics of the Roman imperial system, culminating in a very strange but very public coup attempt. To remember her as merely the “Imperial Whore” and “most promiscuous woman in Rome” does her a disservice. Messalina was a much more complicated, and interesting, scandal than that.the past and all that is in it
