Spring marks many changes: warmer weather, longer days, blooming flowers—and, for many people around the world, the beginning of daylight saving time.

In the United States, however, there’s a growing push to do away with this particular rite of spring. A bipartisan group of lawmakers in the U.S. Congress has once again introduced a bill to make daylight saving time permanent. Known as the Sunshine Protection Act, the bill shocked the country when it passed in the Senate in 2022. Though it eventually died a slow death in the House of Representatives, the bill will now wend its way through the legislative process yet again.

The idea behind the clock shift, often incorrectly called daylight savings time, is to maximize sunlight in the Northern Hemisphere. But people have long argued over the benefits of the time shift. Some point to studies showing that it can harm your health, while others argue that the extra hours of daylight allow people to get outdoors in the evening.

But what exactly is daylight saving time, and when does it begin this year? Here’s a look at the history of the time shift and why it’s so controversial today. (Learn about daylight saving time with your kids.)

When is daylight saving time this year?

In 2023, daylight saving time begins on March 12 and ends on November 5.

Clocks change at 2:00 a.m. local time on the second Sunday in March, when clocks spring forward an hour—typically causing observers to lose an hour of sleep. Daylight saving time ends at 2:00 a.m. local time on the first Sunday in November, when clocks fall back by an hour and observers gain an hour of sleep.

What's behind the changes in sunlight?

Seasonal shifts in the length of a day come from Earth's off-kilter rotation. Our planet turns on its axis at a relatively constant 23.4-degree angle relative to its path around the sun. This means that while the Equator usually enjoys roughly 12 hours of both day and night year round, the same isn't true the further north or south you go.

Summertime marks the Northern Hemisphere's time to shine. It leans toward the sun, causing longer and warmer days. Meanwhile, the Southern Hemisphere is plunged into the short days of winter as it tilts away from the sun. Six months later, the situation reverses, and winter grips the North while light bathes the South.

When coal powered lights, daylight saving time was implemented as a way to add an hour of sunlight to the end of the workday by springing forward and falling back—adding or removing an hour to align with daylight. Because of this, a given region's participation depends, in part, on how far the location is from the Equator. Countries that are farther away have a more pronounced difference in day length between summer and winter and are more likely to participate in the time shift.

Why was daylight saving time created?

Many credit Benjamin Franklin for daylight saving time thanks to a possibly satirical letter he penned for the Journal de Paris in 1784. In the letter, he expressed astonishment to see the sun rise at the early hour of six in the morning, long before most Parisians ever saw the light of day.

If they were to rise with the sun, Franklin wrote, the city could save an “immense sum” from the candles burned in the dark evening hours. He never suggested a shift in clocks, however, instead offering other amusing solutions to the problem that included cannons firing in the street to rouse people from sleep, taxes for shuttered windows, and candle sales restrictions.

Others credit the idea to George Hudson, an entomologist from New Zealand, who in 1895 suggested a two-hour shift to allow for more post-work bug hunting. Soon after, a British activist named William Willett proposed a similar idea to prevent wasting daylight, bringing the concept to England's Parliament in the early 1900s.

It wasn't until resources became scarce during World War I that Germany decided to go ahead with just such a plan, implementing the first daylight saving time in 1916 to maximize resource use during sunlit hours. The United States soon followed suit, with the country's first seasonal time shift taking place in 1918.

Who observes daylight saving time?

Not everyone is in on the clock-changing frenzy. In the U.S., 19 states have passed legislation or resolutions to adopt permanent daylight saving time—but these laws would only go into effect if the U.S. Congress passes its Sunshine Protection Act.

Meanwhile, a handful of states and territories already opt out of daylight saving time entirely: Hawaii, most of Arizona (excluding the Navajo Nation), and the territories of Guam, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Northern Mariana Islands.

Globally, the popularity of changing clocks varies as well. Most of North America, Europe, New Zealand, and a few regions of the Middle East are in on the annual shift, though each have different start and stop dates. But the majority of Africa and Asia do not change their clocks. South America and Australia are split on the matter.

Europe's participation, however, soon may change. In 2019, the European Union voted to end the mandatory time shift, which previously spanned March and October. But that plan seems to be on hold for now: Negotiations have stalled as the bloc deals with fallout from both Brexit and the COVID-19 pandemic.

Are there benefits to daylight saving time?

For many, the change seems meddlesome, resulting in missed meetings and sleepy citizens. There may be even more severe effects. Some studies identified an increase in heart attacks that coincides with springing forward and a slight decrease when falling back. Other studies suggest the time change could be linked to an increase of fatal car accidents, though the effect is small relative to the total number of crashes each year. Still other concerns include impacts to the immune system due to the inevitable sleep loss.

What's more, many studies have questioned whether there have ever been energy savings at all. A 2008 study from the U.S. Department of Energy suggested that in the United States, an extra four weeks of daylight saving time saved about 0.5 percent in total electricity a day. But others conclude the situation is largely a wash: The later sunlight hours do often reduce electricity use during this time, but they also spur more intense use of air conditioning in the evening or greater energy demands to light up the dark mornings.

Even so, those impacts may be location specific. One study found that daylight saving time caused an increase in energy demand and pollution emissions in Indiana, while another found it led to slight reductions in energy use in Norway and Sweden.

These days, arguments in favor of daylight saving time generally center on the boost the time shift gives to evening activities. People tend to go outside when it's light after work—playing sports, going for walks, taking kids to the playground—rather than sitting on the couch. Many outdoor industries, including golf and barbecue, have even promoted daylight saving time, which they say boosts profits. The petroleum industry is also a fan, as people drive more if it is still light after work or school.

But in many places, the time shift is very unpopular. Europe's pending move away from the annual change stemmed from a survey that revealed roughly 80 percent of some 4.6 million respondents were against daylight saving time.

For now, however, if you live in a region that shifts the clocks twice a year, be wary of its effects.Coronaviruses aren’t new. In this episode of our podcast, Overheard at National Geographic, we examine what it takes to find a treatment for coronaviruses and what that might mean for the future of COVID-19.Every six months, once in March and again in September, an equinox splits Earth’s day almost in half, giving us about 12 hours of daylight and 12 of night.

On March 20, 2023, the vernal equinox will signal the coming of spring for the Northern Hemisphere. Then, on September 23, nature will once again bring us the autumnal equinox, the time of year that ushers in fall in the North. Those dates are swapped for the vernal and autumnal equinoxes in the Southern Hemisphere. (Here's why each season begins twice.)

Why do equinoxes happen?

Our planet normally orbits the sun on an axis that’s tilted 23.5 degrees, meaning that the hemispheres trade off getting more warmth from the sun. Two times a year, Earth’s orbit and its axial tilt combine so that the sun sits right above Earth’s Equator, casting the dividing line between the light and dark parts of the planet—the so-called terminator, or twilight zone—through the North and South Poles.

The terminator doesn’t perfectly divide the planet into dark and light; Earth’s atmosphere bends sunlight by 37 miles (60 kilometers), which equals half a degree. That means one half of the planet is still a little more lit than the other, even on an equinox.

Earth isn’t the only planet that experiences equinoxes: Every planet in our solar system has them. In 2009, the Cassini probe in orbit around Saturn captured an equinox on the ringed planet. As on Earth, equinoxes occur every half-year on Saturn, but that equals 15 years on Earth, making Cassini's photo session a unique event.

Marking the equinox

Ancient cultures have tracked the equinoxes in different ways over the millennia. From constructed monuments, like pyramids, to stone engravings that acted as calendars, to churches that incorporated the sun into their architecture, civilizations marked the passing of the sun and the seasons with great accuracy.

(Listen: In this episode of our podcast Overheard, we chat about Nowruz, an ancient Persian holiday marking the new year at the moment of the vernal equinox.)

Some cultures continue to celebrate the equinox today, like the Lakota Tribe of the U.S. Midwest. The Lakota connect the earth with the sky by making tobacco from the red willow tree, which matches the Dried Willow constellation, where the sun rises on the spring equinox. They smoke this sacred tobacco in a ceremony marking the return of longer days.

And at Stonehenge's equinox celebrations in England, druids, pagans, and anyone else who wants to join in gather to witness the sunrise over the ancient stones.Humans have spent millennia attempting to unlock the secrets of the pyramids of Giza. Built some 4,500 years ago, they contain tombs and chambers that once held the remains of early Egyptian pharaohs.

But modern technology has revealed that the pyramids also contain hidden voids. In 2016 and 2017, a group of researchers known as the ScanPyramids project identified several such cavities within the pyramids. And, this week, the Egyptian authorities announced new details about one of voids: the North Face Corridor, which lies just above the entrance to the Pyramid of Khufu (the "Great Pyramid"), the largest of the pyramids on the Giza Plateau.

(Learn more about the pyramids of Giza.)

With the help of a technology called muon radiography—which uses cosmic ray particles to probe objects and construct 3-D models of their insides—scientists have confirmed that the North Face Corridor stretches 30 feet long and over six feet wide.

Archaeologists are skeptical that these empty spaces have any ritual significance. As archaeologist Kate Spence told National Geographic in 2017, and as archaeologist Mark Lehner told the New York Times, research has shown that Egyptians likely built gaps into the pyramids to relieve pressure and keep them structurally sound.

(Read about the 2017 discovery of a mysterious void in Egypt's Great Pyramid.)

Still, like the pyramids themselves, these voids continue to fascinate us. So how do we know they exist—and how do scientists measure them? Here’s the science behind the technology.

The science of muon radiography

Scientists got a better glimpse of the pyramid’s innards thanks to a clever imaging technique called muon radiography, which was first tested in the field at the Pyramids of Giza more than 50 years ago.

Muon radiography relies on the muon, a kind of subatomic particle very similar to the electron, except it’s about 200 times more massive and lasts only a few millionths of a second. Despite their short lifespans, muons are constantly raining down on us. Extreme cosmic objects in the Milky Way and elsewhere constantly produce high-energy particles that occasionally smack into Earth. When these particles—called cosmic rays—collide with our upper atmosphere, the impact produces a spray of particles that includes muons.

Earth’s natural muon drizzle poses no threat. If you’re reading this story on a modern smartphone, 10 muons will have harmlessly passed through your screen by the time you finish this sentence. Muons also have just the right properties to help out scientists trying to see through structures—whether they be pyramids, monasteries, or volcanoes. They pack enough punch to pass through solid objects, and they’re also straightforward to detect with special emulsion films and detectors.

Crucially, muons pass through empty space much more easily than they do through solid objects. So by setting up a series of muon detectors at different locations and angles within a structure, scientists can map out what’s solid and what’s an empty void.

That’s exactly what the researchers did here, as described in a new study published in the journal Nature Communications. Two different teams of researchers—one from Japan’s Nagoya University, the other from France’s Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission—set up a series of muon detectors within two known passages in the pyramid: its descending corridor, and a passageway dug into the pyramid in the ninth century A.D. that now serves as the tourist entrance. These detectors were set up to face the previously discovered North Face Corridor.

After months of data collection starting in 2019, researchers combined the different muon measurements to figure out the size and placement of the North Face Corridor’s empty space. In all, the void is about 30 feet long, about seven feet tall, and about seven feet wide.

But while researchers have now obtained precise measurements for the corridor, its exact purpose in the Great Pyramid will remain a mystery to some—and a confirmation of ancient Egypt’s well-known engineering prowess to others.Coronaviruses aren’t new. In this episode of our podcast, Overheard at National Geographic, we examine what it takes to find a treatment for coronaviruses and what that might mean for the future of COVID-19.When evening approaches, caregivers of dementia patients know to be on their guard for sundowning: a constellation of behaviors that can include restlessness, agitation, aggression, confusion, and wandering.

“Nurses will talk about it like almost a light switch,” says Trey Todd, a neuroscientist at the University of Wyoming who wrote a 2020 review of the scientific literature on sundowning. These behaviors tend to begin around the same time in the late afternoon or early evening and last for roughly four hours.

Sundowning is frequently described among patients with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias, but not all people with those disorders experience it. Reports of its prevalence differ, but Todd says the most conservative estimates suggest about 20 percent of dementia patients will experience sundowning at some point.

(These 'zombie cells' could hold the secret to Alzheimer's cure.)

When it does happen, sundowning can upend life for both people with dementia and their caregivers. It can disrupt sleep for an entire household and even put patients at risk of harming themselves or others. Experts say sundowning is often what drives families to seek full-time professional care for their loved ones.

Scientists still have a long way to go to understand sundowning—but in the meantime, they have identified treatments that may offer relief.

What is sundowning?

Even though it has been described by doctors for more than 80 years—originally called “senile nocturnal delirium” in 1941—scientists still haven’t settled on a definition for sundowning. Milap Nowrangi, a neuropsychiatrist at Johns Hopkins Medicine, says it’s “more of a phenomenon than it is a symptom or a syndrome.”

The characteristics and frequency of sundowning vary widely, but Nowrangi’s patients and their families describe some typical changes. Right around sundown, their loved ones tend to become confused, agitated, and restless. They might start to pace, tug at their clothing, ask to go home even though they are home, or even hallucinate. Their distress is visible to their caregivers and might last for a few hours until they go to sleep.

These characteristics may be primarily cognitive and behavioral, but Todd says that sundowning seems to have an emotional underpinning—“almost like mood swings at a particular part of day.”

Although severe sundowning is associated with Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia, older people without dementia occasionally report mild sundowning-like symptoms. Nowrangi says that could be explained by the natural changes in an aging brain, and he adds that scientists are exploring whether it could be a marker for future development of dementia.

What causes sundowning?

Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias cause structures throughout the brain to slowly degrade—which is partly why it’s so hard to pinpoint what causes sundowning. The malady is also nearly impossible to study: People who are experiencing it are generally too agitated to sit through diagnostic tests like blood work and MRIs. But the curious timing of sundowning has led many scientists to suspect it’s related to a dysfunction in a person’s circadian rhythm.

The circadian rhythm is the 24-hour cycle that regulates all of the body’s natural processes—hunger, thirst, sex drive, body temperature, blood pressure, and sleep. It is all orchestrated by a pacemaker in the brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus, or SCN, which is located right behind the eyes in the hypothalamus.

There’s some evidence that this rhythm is thrown off in people who experience sundowning, says Donald Bliwise, a professor of neurology at Emory University School of Medicine. But he argues that a circadian dysfunction alone wouldn’t account for why these negative behaviors are so pronounced at sunset.

“My thinking broadly is that it’s still kind of an open question,” he says.

Todd says he believes sundowning is a circadian issue—but we don’t know whether it’s caused by a misfiring chemical in the brain such as melatonin or some other malfunction in the neural pathways. That’s what his lab is trying to find out.

They’ve started by looking at the ventromedial hypothalamus, a structure near the SCN that has been shown to regulate aggression in mice by releasing a chemical in the evenings, allowing them to wind down for sleep. In a 2018 study, Todd and his colleagues found that deleting the gene that releases that chemical caused mice to exhibit sundowning-like behavior.

But humans have much more complex brains than mice—and Todd says there’s nothing about the pathology of the hypothalamus to definitively point to it as the problem. His team is now investigating whether the dysfunction could be caused elsewhere, perhaps in the brain stem.

How is sundowning treated?

Since we don’t know what causes sundowning, it hasn’t been possible to develop any targeted treatments. But experts say that there’s some evidence you can ease symptoms with at-home therapies.

One such method is through bright light therapy, which is often prescribed to people with circadian rhythm-related conditions such as seasonal depression and jet lag. Exposure to bright light during the day stimulates the SCN and helps keep the circadian rhythm on track, which some studies have shown can help patients with dementia. Similarly, studies have shown that exercise can alleviate sundowning symptoms through the same mechanism.

(What is seasonal depression—and how do you treat it?)

Caregivers can also make sure nothing extraneous contributes to sundowning, says Beth Kallmyer of the Alzheimer’s Association. For example, aromatherapy and soft music can be used to block out unwanted smells or noises. It’s also important to make sure the person isn’t hungry, thirsty, or cold, and to avoid alcohol and caffeine, which can make agitation worse.

“A lot of it is trial and error, which can be frustrating,” Kallmyer says. But caregivers needn’t deal with sundowning alone. The Alzheimer’s Association offers a 24/7 helpline with dementia specialists and social workers who can help families figure out how to cope—even in the middle of an episode.

If sundowning persists, however, a doctor may turn to medication. Nowrangi says patients with particularly severe symptoms may be prescribed anti-psychotic drugs to promote sleep. These are the same drugs used to treat psychiatric diseases like bipolar disease and schizophrenia, which have similar symptoms to sundowning.

“It’s a poor excuse to use a medication for something, but it’s what we’ve got,” Nowrangi says.

These drugs can have harmful cardiac side effects, however, and the sedation can be dangerous if a patient tries to move around. Taken in the long term, they can destabilize blood sugars. That’s why Nowrangi says that doctors should turn to them only if it’s necessary to get a patient through a rough patch. But it’s a tough line to walk, he adds—you don’t want to wait so long to prescribe medication that a patient causes harm to themselves or someone else.

Ultimately, however, more research is needed to help patients—and their caregivers—cope with sundowning.

“We’re miles ahead of where we were even five years ago,” Todd says. “I know that’s not comforting at all for people who are dealing with loved ones who have Alzheimer’s disease. But you’ve got to start somewhere, and I think we’re headed in the right direction.”Coronaviruses aren’t new.

The question has been on the minds of many with the emergence of powerful artificial intelligence and ChatGPT, a deep learning machine that can converse with—and sometimes fool—human users. Users of the Bing search engine’s chatbot, which draws on ChatGPT technology, even report unnerving conversations in which the AI professes its love for them.

In 1950, Alan Turing had an answer to that question—a computer was capable of “thought” if its output was so convincing that a person interacting with it couldn’t distinguish its answers from those of a real human. The concept, known as the Turing test, has regained new prominence today as some argue that this new generation of AI does in fact pass the Turing test.

(This ‘Countess of Computing’ wrote the first computer program.)

But who was Turing, and why are his ideas about computing and AI still so important today? Here’s what you should know about the legendary English mathematician, codebreaker, and computer scientist.

Alan Turing’s early life

Born in London in 1912, Turing was the son of a high-ranking British colonial administrator based in India. His parents, however, did not want their children brought up there, so they left them to be raised by family friends. According to biographer Andrew Hodges, he was a lonely child raised in “various English homes where nothing encouraged expression, originality, or discovery.” But young Turing had a unique and brilliant mind.

At boarding school, a teenage Turing formed a close bond with his classmate, Christopher Morcom, over their love of science. When Morcom died unexpectedly in 1930, Turing was devastated. In letters to Morcom’s mother, he wondered whether Morcom’s mind could possibly live on without his body.

(Listen to Overheard at National Geographic’s podcast episode on the battle for the soul of artificial intelligence.)

The loss changed Turing, plunging him into a philosophical, mathematical, and scientific investigation of the human mind that would last a lifetime. He pursued advanced scientific and mathematical studies, receiving a degree in mathematics from Cambridge University in 1934 and a doctorate in mathematics from Princeton University in 1938.

As a postgraduate student, Turing wrote an influential proof challenging a theory of venerated mathematician David Hilbert, who surmised that there was no such thing as an unsolvable mathematical problem. As part of the proof, Turing laid out a thought experiment that described a device now known as the Turing “machine.” The hypothetical device could read input from an infinitely long tape and solve problems according to a set of rules. A true Turing machine was impossible to build, but the concept—a replicable machine that could be programmed, store information, and perform calculations—set the stage for modern computers.

Enigma and WWII codebreaking

During World War II, Turing worked on another form of complex computation: codebreaking. He was tasked with tackling how to decipher German messages scrambled by Enigma, a machine that turned words into gibberish. The code that resulted could only be deciphered by someone with their own Enigma machine and a separate key that told them to configure it—and changed daily.

Enigma could generate billions of possible combinations, and had stumped Allied codebreakers. But within weeks of arriving at Bletchley Park—a code and cypher school that was home to Allied codebreaking efforts—Turing cracked the code. He did so by designing Victory, a machine that mechanized codebreaking by using multiple Enigmas to narrow down the probable messages. With Turing’s help, Allied forces knew when and where German U-boats planned to attack.

When the Germans switched to the Lorenz, an even more complex device, Turing developed a technique that helped crack its encoded messages, too, giving the Allies an inside look at detailed messages Hitler and his army exchanged with their most senior military officials.

The codebreaking effort at Bletchley Park is thought to have shortened the war by up to four years. Turing “saved Britain from a Nazi dark age,” wrote fellow codebreaker Jerry Roberts—and the British government agreed, awarding Turing the Order of the British Empire, the nation’s highest honor, for his wartime achievements. But the operation, and Turing’s role in it, remained secret until the 1970s, when Bletchley Park’s role in World War II was declassified.

The Imitation Game

But the secrecy of Turing’s work at Bletchley Park hampered him professionally. In 1945 he proposed an advanced calculating device he called the Automatic Computing Engine (ACE)—a computer that would have been the most advanced of its era.

“ACE was the first complete electronic computer design,” writes computer engineer and historian Brian Edward Carpenter. However, Turing had trouble convincing his colleagues, who were in the dark about his earlier successes, that the idea was feasible. He had to fight to have it built, and when British government workers produced the first ACE, it was a simpler model.

Turing went on to work at the Victoria University of Manchester, where he continued exploring his idea of a universal computing machine. There, he also tackled the concept of artificial intelligence and grappled with questions about whether machines could think.

In 1950, Turing responded to a growing debate about these issues with a groundbreaking paper describing a thought experiment he called the “imitation game.” In the experiment, a person in an isolated room poses questions to a man and woman in another room, receives their answers in writing, then attempts to determine the sex of both. If one of the humans answering questions was replaced by a machine that fooled the questioner with human-like answers, Turing proposed, the machine was “intelligent.”

(Here’s how another of Turing’s theories is helping us unlock the secrets of flowers.)

In the paper, Turing also compared the human mind to a machine, and proposed that one day machines might be able to teach one another. Though unthinkable with the technology of his time, the concept is at the heart of modern machine learning and artificial intelligence. Modern technologies like ChatGPT are trained on huge datasets that they draw upon to solve problems and converse with humans.

Turing’s test remains hotly debated to this day, and has prompted decades of spinoffs, arguments, and experiments—all of which engage with the modern devices he envisioned while limited by his era’s insufficient technology.

Turing’s last days

Turing had a brilliant mind. But his sexuality put him at risk at a time when homosexuality was against the law.

In 1952, Turing’s home was burgled and, during the course of the investigation, he told police that the burglar was his former boyfriend. Turing was charged with gross indecency and pleaded guilty. Rather than serve a jail sentence, which would have cost him his job, he opted for probation and “chemical castration”—injection with estrogen—designed to reduce his sexual libido.

As a convicted criminal, Turing lost his security clearance, and his year of estrogen injections rendered him impotent. On June 7, 1954, his housekeeper found him in his bed, dead at 41. A half-eaten apple, suspected by some to have been laced with cyanide, was found near his body.

Though his death was ruled a suicide due to cyanide poisoning, it remains unclear whether he intended to kill himself. Today, historians see Turing as a brilliant victim of his era’s biases. And over time, his contribution to both the war effort and modern computer science is becoming clearer.

So is his prescience. As he said in a 1951 interview, “If a machine can think, it might think more intelligently than we can. And then where would we be?”Coronaviruses aren’t new.

Some point to studies showing that it can harm your health, while others argue that the extra hours of daylight allow people to get outdoors in the evening.

But what exactly is daylight saving time, and when does it begin this year? Here’s a look at the history of the time shift and why it’s so controversial today. (Learn about daylight saving time with your kids.)

When is daylight saving time this year?

In 2023, daylight saving time begins on March 12 and ends on November 5.

Clocks change at 2:00 a.m. local time on the second Sunday in March, when clocks spring forward an hour—typically causing observers to lose an hour of sleep. Daylight saving time ends at 2:00 a.m. local time on the first Sunday in November, when clocks fall back by an hour and observers gain an hour of sleep.

What's behind the changes in sunlight?

Seasonal shifts in the length of a day come from Earth's off-kilter rotation. Our planet turns on its axis at a relatively constant 23.4-degree angle relative to its path around the sun. This means that while the Equator usually enjoys roughly 12 hours of both day and night year round, the same isn't true the further north or south you go.

Summertime marks the Northern Hemisphere's time to shine. It leans toward the sun, causing longer and warmer days. Meanwhile, the Southern Hemisphere is plunged into the short days of winter as it tilts away from the sun. Six months later, the situation reverses, and winter grips the North while light bathes the South.

When coal powered lights, daylight saving time was implemented as a way to add an hour of sunlight to the end of the workday by springing forward and falling back—adding or removing an hour to align with daylight. Because of this, a given region's participation depends, in part, on how far the location is from the Equator. Countries that are farther away have a more pronounced difference in day length between summer and winter and are more likely to participate in the time shift.

Why was daylight saving time created?

Many credit Benjamin Franklin for daylight saving time thanks to a possibly satirical letter he penned for the Journal de Paris in 1784. In the letter, he expressed astonishment to see the sun rise at the early hour of six in the morning, long before most Parisians ever saw the light of day.

If they were to rise with the sun, Franklin wrote, the city could save an “immense sum” from the candles burned in the dark evening hours. He never suggested a shift in clocks, however, instead offering other amusing solutions to the problem that included cannons firing in the street to rouse people from sleep, taxes for shuttered windows, and candle sales restrictions.

Others credit the idea to George Hudson, an entomologist from New Zealand, who in 1895 suggested a two-hour shift to allow for more post-work bug hunting. Soon after, a British activist named William Willett proposed a similar idea to prevent wasting daylight, bringing the concept to England's Parliament in the early 1900s.

It wasn't until resources became scarce during World War I that Germany decided to go ahead with just such a plan, implementing the first daylight saving time in 1916 to maximize resource use during sunlit hours. The United States soon followed suit, with the country's first seasonal time shift taking place in 1918.

Who observes daylight saving time?

Not everyone is in on the clock-changing frenzy. In the U.S., 19 states have passed legislation or resolutions to adopt permanent daylight saving time—but these laws would only go into effect if the U.S. Congress passes its Sunshine Protection Act.

Meanwhile, a handful of states and territories already opt out of daylight saving time entirely: Hawaii, most of Arizona (excluding the Navajo Nation), and the territories of Guam, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Northern Mariana Islands.

Globally, the popularity of changing clocks varies as well. Most of North America, Europe, New Zealand, and a few regions of the Middle East are in on the annual shift, though each have different start and stop dates. But the majority of Africa and Asia do not change their clocks. South America and Australia are split on the matter.

Europe's participation, however, soon may change. In 2019, the European Union voted to end the mandatory time shift, which previously spanned March and October. But that plan seems to be on hold for now: Negotiations have stalled as the bloc deals with fallout from both Brexit and the COVID-19 pandemic.

Are there benefits to daylight saving time?

For many, the change seems meddlesome, resulting in missed meetings and sleepy citizens. There may be even more severe effects. Some studies identified an increase in heart attacks that coincides with springing forward and a slight decrease when falling back. Other studies suggest the time change could be linked to an increase of fatal car accidents, though the effect is small relative to the total number of crashes each year. Still other concerns include impacts to the immune system due to the inevitable sleep loss.

What's more, many studies have questioned whether there have ever been energy savings at all. A 2008 study from the U.S. Department of Energy suggested that in the United States, an extra four weeks of daylight saving time saved about 0.5 percent in total electricity a day. But others conclude the situation is largely a wash: The later sunlight hours do often reduce electricity use during this time, but they also spur more intense use of air conditioning in the evening or greater energy demands to light up the dark mornings.

Even so, those impacts may be location specific. One study found that daylight saving time caused an increase in energy demand and pollution emissions in Indiana, while another found it led to slight reductions in energy use in Norway and Sweden.

These days, arguments in favor of daylight saving time generally center on the boost the time shift gives to evening activities. People tend to go outside when it's light after work—playing sports, going for walks, taking kids to the playground—rather than sitting on the couch. Many outdoor industries, including golf and barbecue, have even promoted daylight saving time, which they say boosts profits. The petroleum industry is also a fan, as people drive more if it is still light after work or school.

But in many places, the time shift is very unpopular. Europe's pending move away from the annual change stemmed from a survey that revealed roughly 80 percent of some 4.6 million respondents were against daylight saving time.

For now, however, if you live in a region that shifts the clocks twice a year, be wary of its effects.Coronaviruses aren’t new. In this episode of our podcast, Overheard at National Geographic, we examine what it takes to find a treatment for coronaviruses and what that might mean for the future of COVID-19.Every six months, once in March and again in September, an equinox splits Earth’s day almost in half, giving us about 12 hours of daylight and 12 of night.

On March 20, 2023, the vernal equinox will signal the coming of spring for the Northern Hemisphere. Then, on September 23, nature will once again bring us the autumnal equinox, the time of year that ushers in fall in the North. Those dates are swapped for the vernal and autumnal equinoxes in the Southern Hemisphere. (Here's why each season begins twice.)

Why do equinoxes happen?

Our planet normally orbits the sun on an axis that’s tilted 23.5 degrees, meaning that the hemispheres trade off getting more warmth from the sun. Two times a year, Earth’s orbit and its axial tilt combine so that the sun sits right above Earth’s Equator, casting the dividing line between the light and dark parts of the planet—the so-called terminator, or twilight zone—through the North and South Poles.

The terminator doesn’t perfectly divide the planet into dark and light; Earth’s atmosphere bends sunlight by 37 miles (60 kilometers), which equals half a degree. That means one half of the planet is still a little more lit than the other, even on an equinox.

Earth isn’t the only planet that experiences equinoxes: Every planet in our solar system has them. In 2009, the Cassini probe in orbit around Saturn captured an equinox on the ringed planet. As on Earth, equinoxes occur every half-year on Saturn, but that equals 15 years on Earth, making Cassini's photo session a unique event.

Marking the equinox

Ancient cultures have tracked the equinoxes in different ways over the millennia. From constructed monuments, like pyramids, to stone engravings that acted as calendars, to churches that incorporated the sun into their architecture, civilizations marked the passing of the sun and the seasons with great accuracy.

(Listen: In this episode of our podcast Overheard, we chat about Nowruz, an ancient Persian holiday marking the new year at the moment of the vernal equinox.)

Some cultures continue to celebrate the equinox today, like the Lakota Tribe of the U.S. Midwest. The Lakota connect the earth with the sky by making tobacco from the red willow tree, which matches the Dried Willow constellation, where the sun rises on the spring equinox. They smoke this sacred tobacco in a ceremony marking the return of longer days.

And at Stonehenge's equinox celebrations in England, druids, pagans, and anyone else who wants to join in gather to witness the sunrise over the ancient stones.Humans have spent millennia attempting to unlock the secrets of the pyramids of Giza. Built some 4,500 years ago, they contain tombs and chambers that once held the remains of early Egyptian pharaohs.

But modern technology has revealed that the pyramids also contain hidden voids. In 2016 and 2017, a group of researchers known as the ScanPyramids project identified several such cavities within the pyramids. And, this week, the Egyptian authorities announced new details about one of voids: the North Face Corridor, which lies just above the entrance to the Pyramid of Khufu (the "Great Pyramid"), the largest of the pyramids on the Giza Plateau.

With the help of a technology called muon radiography—which uses cosmic ray particles to probe objects and construct 3-D models of their insides—scientists have confirmed that the North Face Corridor stretches 30 feet long and over six feet wide.

Archaeologists are skeptical that these empty spaces have any ritual significance. As archaeologist Kate Spence told National Geographic in 2017, and as archaeologist Mark Lehner told the New York Times, research has shown that Egyptians likely built gaps into the pyramids to relieve pressure and keep them structurally sound.

(Read about the 2017 discovery of a mysterious void in Egypt's Great Pyramid.)

Still, like the pyramids themselves, these voids continue to fascinate us. So how do we know they exist—and how do scientists measure them? Here’s the science behind the technology.

The science of muon radiography

Scientists got a better glimpse of the pyramid’s innards thanks to a clever imaging technique called muon radiography, which was first tested in the field at the Pyramids of Giza more than 50 years ago.

Muon radiography relies on the muon, a kind of subatomic particle very similar to the electron, except it’s about 200 times more massive and lasts only a few millionths of a second. Despite their short lifespans, muons are constantly raining down on us. Extreme cosmic objects in the Milky Way and elsewhere constantly produce high-energy particles that occasionally smack into Earth. When these particles—called cosmic rays—collide with our upper atmosphere, the impact produces a spray of particles that includes muons.

Earth’s natural muon drizzle poses no threat. If you’re reading this story on a modern smartphone, 10 muons will have harmlessly passed through your screen by the time you finish this sentence. Muons also have just the right properties to help out scientists trying to see through structures—whether they be pyramids, monasteries, or volcanoes. They pack enough punch to pass through solid objects, and they’re also straightforward to detect with special emulsion films and detectors.

Crucially, muons pass through empty space much more easily than they do through solid objects. So by setting up a series of muon detectors at different locations and angles within a structure, scientists can map out what’s solid and what’s an empty void.

That’s exactly what the researchers did here, as described in a new study published in the journal Nature Communications. Two different teams of researchers—one from Japan’s Nagoya University, the other from France’s Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission—set up a series of muon detectors within two known passages in the pyramid: its descending corridor, and a passageway dug into the pyramid in the ninth century A.D. that now serves as the tourist entrance. These detectors were set up to face the previously discovered North Face Corridor.

After months of data collection starting in 2019, researchers combined the different muon measurements to figure out the size and placement of the North Face Corridor’s empty space. In all, the void is about 30 feet long, about seven feet tall, and about seven feet wide.

But while researchers have now obtained precise measurements for the corridor, its exact purpose in the Great Pyramid will remain a mystery to some—and a confirmation of ancient Egypt’s well-known engineering prowess to others.
