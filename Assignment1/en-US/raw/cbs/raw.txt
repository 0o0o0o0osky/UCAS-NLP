A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket carried a third batch of 40 OneWeb internet satellites into orbit Thursday, helping the London-based company expand its constellation of broadband relay stations to 582 operational spacecraft.

Another group of 36 OneWeb satellites, scheduled for launch later this month atop an Indian GSLV rocket, will give the company global coverage with a final SpaceX flight on tap later this year to top off the fleet at nearly 650.

For Thursday's flight, the Falcon 9, using a first stage booster making its 13th flight, blasted off from pad 40 at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station at 2:13 p.m. EST, quickly racing away on a southeasterly trajectory.

The well-traveled first stage boosted the rocket out of the lower atmosphere and then fell away to fly itself back to a picture-perfect landing at the Space Force station while the second stage continued the climb to orbit. The landing marked SpaceX's 177th successful booster recovery and its 32nd at Cape Canaveral.

The second stage, meanwhile, reached its planned orbit after two engine firings and the first two 325-pound OneWeb satellites were released to fly on their own about an hour after launch. The remaining 38 were released over the next 36 minutes.

Deployed in an initial 373-mile-high orbit tilted 87 degrees to the equator, the solar-powered satellites will use on-board xenon ion thrusters to reach their operational altitude of about 745 miles.

SpaceX and OneWeb are both building space-based constellations of broadband relay satellites, but the two companies are targeting different segments of the data communications marketplace.

SpaceX is launching thousands of low-altitude Starlink internet satellites -- 4,053 have been launched to date -- to provide high-speed, low-latency broadband access to consumers around the world as well as government agencies and commercial customers.

OneWeb is focused more on government/commercial maritime, aviation and land-based mobility markets using a much smaller number of higher-altitude satellites. With Thursday's launch, OneWeb's constellation grew to 582 operational spacecraft.

Getting to this point has not been easy, as the company has had to weather bankruptcy and the impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Two of the last four OneWeb satellites launched Thursday drift off into space, one just leaving the second stage dispenser and the other at extreme upper right. Forty OneWeb satellites were deployed in all. SpaceX

OneWeb's first 13 launches used Russian Soyuz rockets. Last March, the company was gearing up for its 14th launch aboard another Soyuz when the Ukraine invasion triggered harsh western sanctions. In retaliation, Russia demanded that OneWeb cut its ties with the British government, which is a partial owner of the company.

OneWeb refused, and Russia confiscated the satellites awaiting launch at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. OneWeb then scrambled to build replacements and booked its next flight on an Indian GSLV that successfully flew last October. SpaceX then launch two batches of 40 OneWeb satellites in December and January.

Thursday's launch was the third of four currently booked with SpaceX.New diet trends are taking on climate change, one plate at a time.

You may have heard of "meatless Mondays" or maybe even "vegan before 6." Now, more consumers are making deliberate food choices and even altering entire dietary practices with sustainability in mind.

"Young people are definitely concerned about the planet. They know they have many, many more years left and they want there to be a healthy and sustainable planet," says Brian Kateman. The author and documentarian decided to eat less meat after learning how damaging it is to the environment. Kateman even coined a term for it: reducetarian.

"A reducetarian is anyone who's made the decision to cut back on the amount of animal products that they consume - so that's meat, eggs and dairy," says Kateman.

According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, nearly 15% of all greenhouse gas emissions come from meat production.

"It takes a lot of resources," says Kateman. "You think of the land, you think of the water, you think of all the food you have to feed to the animals."

A 2022 Earth Day report from the consulting firm Kearney found that 80% of consumers had at least some awareness of the connection between food choice and the environment. The report identified a growing segment of consumers it calls "Climavores," and anticipated that in coming years routine food choices will be more climate-directed.

The food production industry is paying attention and companies are trying to latch on to younger, climate-conscious consumers.

"It's a competitive advantage for companies to be seen as at the forefront of doing something about climate change," says marketing expert Michelle Greenwald.

While there's no single standard for carbon footprint labeling, some restaurant chains are touting their efforts right on their menus. Panera identifies its low-carbon entrees with a "Cool Food Meal" symbol, and Just Salad offers a "climatarian" filter on its app. Greenwald expects this practice to catch on.

"There's going to be more carbon footprint labeling on food, and I think it's going to be a factor in how consumers make choices about what to eat."

Kateman acknowledges that Americans have an attachment to meat. "We grew up with it, we go to baseball games and have hot dogs, we have traditions around holidays. Meat is definitely ingrained in American culture."

But he believes those habits can evolve. "I think it's a more tolerable idea to cut back rather than necessarily go vegan or vegetarian," says Kateman.

That starts with swapping in plant-based ingredients where meat used to be. For example, "I still have burritos — I just have guacamole instead," says Kateman. "Or I still have pasta, but instead of meatballs I make it primavera with vegetables."Out of the millions of asteroids in our solar system, there's a very small fraction known to potentially impact Earth. But scientists found a new one just two weeks ago that so far seems to pose one of the greatest risks of them all.

The asteroid, known as 2023 DW, was only first discovered on Feb. 26, according to the European Space Agency. It's now been added to the agency's Risk List, a catalog of space objects that could potentially have some kind of impact on Earth, and because of what scientists have so far seen – it's ranking on the list is currently at No. 1.

But don't worry, that doesn't mean catastrophic damage is imminent.

2023 DW has a Torino Scale ranking of 1, meaning that it's currently predicted to pose "no unusual level of danger," according to the scale. Researchers believe that it has about a 50-meter diameter – about the length of an Olympic-sized swimming pool – but said that the "size uncertainty could be large."

"Current calculations show the chance of collision is extremely unlikely with no cause for public attention or public concern," that ranking categorization states. All of the other 1,448 asteroids on the Risk List have a scale ranking of 0.

The ESA currently estimates that the asteroid has a 1 in 607 chance of impacting Earth.

The soonest the asteroid would potentially impact Earth isn't for more than two decades. According to the European Space Agency, it's predicted that 2023 DW could impact the planet on Valentine's Day 2046. It also has the potential to impact on Valentine's Days thereafter – from 2047 to 2051, according to the Risk List.

NASA's Planetary Defense Coordination Office says that it has been tracking the asteroid and that its risk of impacting Earth in 2046 remains "very small."

"Often when new objects are first discovered, it takes several weeks of data to reduce the uncertainties and adequately predict their orbits years into the future," the office tweeted. "Orbit analysts will continue to monitor asteroid 2023 DW and update predictions as more data comes in."

Astronomer Piero Sicoli said he believes there's about a "1 in 400 chance" that the asteroid will actually have an impact.

"Surely this possibility will soon be ruled out," he tweeted last week. "However, as an exercise, I calculated where the asteroid might fall if this possibility occurred."

A map of his calculations – which could change over time – show that if it were to collide with Earth, it could fall anywhere between the Indian Ocean to just off the U.S. East Coast.

The unveiling, in a square that bears her name, marked the culmination of a two-year project inspired by the iconic image of Tubman standing humble, yet proud. The monument replaces the controversial Christopher Columbus statue which was removed in June 2020.

The monument, called "Shadow of a Face," also includes an audio installation of Tubman's life narrated by singer and actor Queen Latifah, who was born in Newark.

"I hope they take away renewed strength, inspiration, humanity, compassion," Latifah told CBS News of the monument. "What Harriet Tubman did was about freedom, was about compassion for those who did not have it.

Tubman escaped slavery and risked her freedom to lead about 70 enslaved people through the Underground Railroad, a network of safehouses which led north, and included a Newark church, with hidden tunnels.

At the site, visitors will also learn that Tubman was a spy in the Union Army, as well as an advocate for women's rights and the elderly.

Monument designer Nina Cooke John said she intentionally placed a mosaic of Tubman's face at eye level.

"You can look into her eyes and touch her face and connect to her, to her humanity," Cooke John told CBS News. "It could be your mother, your aunt, your grandmother, and in so doing, be that much more inspired by her."We may receive commissions from some links to products on this page.

If used according to IRS rules interest paid on a HELOC may be tax-deductible. Getty Images/iStockphoto

It's that time of year again. Taxes are due in just a few short weeks (April 18 for the 2022 filing year) and if you haven't already submitted your return you should probably get moving. You can file quickly and painlessly online with a professional tax service.

For homeowners, filing a return is a mixed bag. For those with substantial interest left on their mortgage, it can be a valuable deduction to take each year. But as that interest goes down and equity grows the refund may not be as large.

Fortunately, there's another way homeowners can benefit when filing their returns. Those who took out a home equity line of credit (HELOC) last year may be able to deduct the interest they paid. This can only happen if specific requirements are met. But, in an economic environment still dealing with inflation and high-interest rates, every dollar counts.

Learn more about how a HELOC can qualify as a tax deduction and why this type of credit may be worth it for some homeowners from a trusted expert. Start exploring your HELOC options here and check your eligibility.

Is a HELOC tax-deductible?

If you took out and used a HELOC in 2022 then its interest may be deductible for the return you're about to file. If you applied and are using one now, however, you'll have to wait until next year to get credit. Those who used a HELOC in 2022 can use it as a deduction if it was used to make major home improvements, the IRS says.

"Interest on home equity loans and lines of credit are deductible only if the borrowed funds are used to buy, build, or substantially improve the taxpayer's home that secures the loan," the IRS explains online. "The loan must be secured by the taxpayer's main home or second home (qualified residence), and meet other requirements."

If these conditions aren't met, the IRS notes, the deduction isn't eligible. So, if you used a HELOC to pay off student loan debt or to pay for a wedding, it won't qualify.

"Generally, you can deduct the home mortgage interest and points reported to you on Form 1098 on Schedule A (Form 1040), line 8a," the IRS says. "However, any interest showing in box 1 of Form 1098 from a home equity loan, or a line of credit or credit card loan secured by the property, is not deductible if the proceeds were not used to buy, build, or substantially improve a qualified home."

Not sure if you'd qualify? Online tax services can help you sort through your return to help maximize your deductions.

Why a HELOC is worth it

In addition to its potential tax deduction each year, a HELOC has other advantages that may appeal to homeowners in search of extra funding. Here are two additional benefits to know:

Interest rates are lower than other credit options. Interest rates on HELOCs are around 6% to 7%, depending on your credit score and other personal factors. While that may not be as low as your mortgage rate, it's still better than a personal loan (around 10% currently) or a credit card (think 20% or more). You can check what HELOC interest rates you're eligible to receive here now.

You can check what HELOC interest rates you're eligible to receive here now. You only pay for what you need. Unlike some other credit types, with a HELOC you'll only pay interest on the amount you actually use - not the amount you were approved for. So, if you apply for a line of credit for $100,000 but only use $20,000 of that amount you'll only be on the hook for the interest from the latter amount.

The bottom line

Interest tied to HELOCs, assuming the HELOC is used for IRS-approved reasons, may be tax deductible. But that's not the only reason why homeowners should turn to HELOCs instead of other credit options. This type of credit generally offers lower interest rates than credit cards and personal loans. And you'll only pay interest on what you use - not the full amount you were approved for at the time of application.

Researchers looked at 196 peer-reviewed articles, which included more than 30 million study participants, to analyze the link between physical activity and cancer, heart disease and early death for the study, which was published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine.

They found that 75 minutes of moderate activity a week lowered the risk of early death overall by 23%.

Just a short, brisk stroll every day could significantly lower your risk of several deadly diseases, Cambridge University researchers said in a study released March 1, 2023. Getty

"We know that physical activity, such as walking or cycling, is good for you, especially if you feel it raises your heart rate. But what we've found is there are substantial benefits to heart health and reducing your risk of cancer even if you can only manage 10 minutes every day," said Professor James Woodcock, from Cambridge's Medical Research Council Epidemiology Unit.

Britain's National Health Service recommends that people get at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise a week. The study found that this level of exercise could prevent 1 in 6 early deaths, but getting more than that only delivered marginal benefits.

75 minutes of moderate exercise a week, or an 11 minute brisk walk per day, was found to reduce the risk of developing cancer by 7% and heart disease by 17%.

For head and neck cancer, myeloma, myeloid leukaemia, myeloma and gastric cardia cancers, the decrease in risk was between 14% and 26%. For other cancers, like breast or colon cancer, the reduction in risk with moderate exercise was lower, at 3-11%.

"Moderate activity doesn't have to involve what we normally think of exercise, such as sports or running. Sometimes, replacing some habits is all that is needed. For example, try to walk or cycle to your work or study place instead of using a car, or engage in active play with your kids or grandkids. Doing activities that you enjoy and that are easy to include in your weekly routine is an excellent way to become more active," said Dr. Leandro Garcia from Queen's University, Belfast, one of the study authors.Exclusive: Spotify releasing biggest update to its platform since its mobile launch

A brand new version of Spotify is being unveiled to millions of subscribers on Wednesday, marking the largest change to the platform since it became available on phones more than a decade ago.

In an exclusive interview airing Thursday on "CBS Mornings," Spotify's CEO and founder, Daniel Ek, said the updates include an "entirely new" home feed that is "completely redesigned from the ground up."

"You'll see Spotify, I think, come alive. You're gonna see a lot more interactive content," he said.

The popular digital music streaming service allows users to access a vast library of songs and podcasts.

Ek said with the change, users will be able to see recommended content in the form of clips, and other visual components.

More of CBS News' Gayle King's interview with Ek will air on "CBS Mornings" on Thursday, March 9. During the interview, Ek will address the ongoing controversies related to podcaster Joe Rogan and the allegations that Spotify fails to fairly pay its artists.The gift bags at the Oscars seem more like Mary Poppins' purse – unbelievably filled with unexpected items. The gift bags, which will be given to Academy Award nominees at the ceremony on Sunday, is appropriately named the "Everyone Wins" Nominee Gift Bags – because even if you don't take home an Oscar, you're taking home a lot of so-called "swag."

This is not your average gift bag with a candle or some chocolate, although those things are in there, too. Nominees will be gifted a free facial rejuvenation procedure from New York City-based plastic surgeon Dr. Konstantin Vasyukevich and a shaman reading from author Jo Bowlby. They'll also get complimentary project management from Maison Construction and a PETA "Stop Monkey Imports to Labs" travel pillow.

The stars will also get an Italian getaway on an island and a stay at an estate in Canada.

There are many food products in the bag – from popcorn to shokupan, a popular Japanese milk bread – and alcohol, including wine and tequila.

Nominees will also receive fertility supplements and several beauty and wellness products, from a "bath ritual set," to a silk pillow case to edible massage oil.

The swag bags are put together by marketing company Distinctive Assets, which has been coordinating these gifts for awards shows like the Grammys and BET Awards since 1999.

Forbes estimates the total cost of this year's gift bag is about $126,000, but Lash Fary, founder of Distinctive Assets, says the value "is neither our focus nor goal."

"These nominees are in a unique position to help participating brands immeasurably by simply wearing, using and talking about these products," Fary said. "Marketing and advertising can and must co-exist with the ever-present reporting of bad news globally. This isn't frivolity; it is basic economics."

The gifts don't stop there. This week, stars were invited to a "gifting suite" at the The Luxe Sunset Boulevard Hotel, where brands are invited to give out free products, coordinated by Dubois Pelin and Associates, a marketing company that promotes brands at such gifting suites.

In the suite, stars can receive a "magical" facial and beauty products, scarves, jewelry, perfume and sheets. Select stars can receive bone marrow and stem cell injections – a $20,000 value and some will receive a trip to French Polynesia, Iceland or Thailand.

Stars will also also get a brand new pair of sneakers, created by a 14-year-old girl from Brooklyn. Middle schooler Amira-Dior Traynham-Artis started her design company, Lane 1, a few years ago. She began selling shoes online, which caught the attention of a management company and a huge offer.

"They would like you to come out to L.A. and provide this sneaker for celebrities attending the Oscars," the young designer's mom, Kenesha Traynham-Cooper, told CBS New York. "I was like, 'What?'"

To be able to make 75 pairs of shoes in time for the gifting suite, another New York company, Gernie Company, helped Traynham-Artis with the manufacturing.

"For me, no matter what the task is, if I really have my mind set on it, especially when it comes to art, I'm going to do it," Traynham-Artis said.

The teen is most excited to potentially meet Zendaya, and while she isn't nominated this year, countless stars will be passing through the suite.

This year's Oscars will be held on Sunday, March 12, at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles. Nominees include Austin Butler, Michelle Yeoh, Ana de Armas, Angela Bassett, Jamie Lee Curtis and Brendan Fraser for their acting roles and singers like Rihanna and Lady Gaga for their original songs.Cumberland, Rhode Island — Maryann O'Connor is juggling two jobs, sometimes working up to 11 hours per day, not what she expected to be doing at age 66.

"I would hope to be retired, playing the piano again, just enjoying my life," O'Connor said.

With no savings or 401(k) — not even enough to cover an emergency — she sold her home and bought a smaller one with two other women.

"It's been a matter of life and death," she said of her current financial situation.

Millions of Americans nearing their golden years are still financially unprepared for retirement. According to U.S. Census Bureau data, 50% of women and 47% of men between the ages of 55 and 66 have no retirement savings.

O'Connor, who adopted and raised three children as a single mother, said she knew she would be in that group.

"I have a live-for-now philosophy, I guess," O'Connor said.

For her and others without a nest egg, experts said it is not too late to make a plan. According to the AARP, that includes continuing to work, lowering your cost of living, saving when you can and delaying social security benefits until age 70 in order to get the largest monthly check possible. You should also avoid risky investments that you think will make up for the lost time.

"The higher the promised returns, the more you want to do in real research before you put your money in something like that," said David John, a senior policy adviser for the AARP Public Policy Institute.

According to AARP, nearly 57 million Americans work for an employer that does not offer a retirement savings plan. O'Connor said her advice to young people is to start saving now.

"I wish I had started earlier," O'Connor said. "But I guess I would now say that they need to start planning as early as they can."

As for O'Connor, she's continuing to work. She formed a company that plans trips for groups of women, and that allows her to see the world for herself, even if she's working while doing it.Credit card debt soars as companies try to lure more customers with perks

Americans are sinking into debt after hunkering down and building their financial savings during the pandemic.

The sharp rise in credit card debt has been a long time coming, with Americans increasingly relying on plastic to make purchases. But the increase is largely driven by factors like inflation and high credit card interest rates, experts say.

Consumers racked up $180 billion in new credit card debt in 2022, the largest amount of debt ever added in a single year, according to a recent study from personal finance website WalletHub. Nearly half of that total — almost $86 billion — was added in the fourth quarter, marking the biggest ever quarterly increase in credit card debt.

The average household's credit card balance was $9,990, up 9% from in the fourth quarter of 2021.

What's driving balances to record levels?

"This is a chronic issue overall where we as a society have gotten more used to using credit for everything," said Michael Reynolds, a certified financial planner and owner of Elevation Financial. "Credit card companies are incredibly good marketers, and credit cards have become the norm and a way of life for everyone."

Consumers become psychologically detached from the purchases they make when using credit, versus a debit card or cash, which are more tangible forms of payment, according to Reynolds. "That detachment makes people feel less pain or stress when they use credit. It doesn't feel like they're spending real money," he said.

More recently, government stimulus programs during the pandemic, like enhanced unemployment benefits, injected cash into households that became accustomed to the financial cushion — even when it dried up.

"I think a lot of people got used to spending cash they didn't otherwise have," Reynolds said. "They got into patterns that involved a higher level of spending that they're now using debt for," he added.

High inflation has also fueled Americans' growing credit card debt, with millions living paycheck-to-paycheck. Typically, it's consumers' day-to-day living expenses, or some kind of emergency expense, that gets folks into trouble — not lavish spending.

"Everything seems to cost more. People are paying more for food, housing and gas. Generally, it's the practical stuff that gets people into credit card debt," said Ted Rossman, credit expert at CreditCards.com. "It's all contributing to increased balances."

Record APR

At the same time, credit card interest rates are rising, causing Americans' outstanding debt to grow faster. The average credit card interest rate rose to a record high of 20.4% this week, according to a CreditCards.com report.

The best way to tackle credit card debt? Stop using your cards, Rossman said. "If you're in a hole, stop digging."

Reynolds encourages his clients to take a three-month credit card break and instead use debit or cash for all purchases.

"Usually they spend less because when you spend on a debit card, it's real money in your bank account and it lowers your balance immediately. With a credit card, there's a month-long detachment from the act of buying something and when you have to actually pay for it," he said.

Rossman's top tip for consumers looking to get out of credit card debt is to transfer all of your debt to a 0% balance transfer card that charges no interest for up to 21 months.

"It's so important to prioritize the interest rate," he said.March's full moon, also known as the "Worm Moon," will shine bright in the sky on Tuesday night.

It will be the last full moon of the winter, the Farmer's Almanac points out. This month's full moon will look even bigger than usual when it's near the horizon shortly after it rises.

Moonrise will be at around 6 p.m. A Farmer's Almanac web page shows specific times for different ZIP codes.

Some areas with rain in the forecast may have a chance of seeing a rare moonbow. It's like a rainbow, but it happens when the moon's light is refracted in drops of rain. Moonbows can only be seen when the full moon is low in the sky, which happens hours after sunset.

The "Worm Moon" was preceded this year by the "Wolf Moon" and "Snow Moon." Next month, astronomy fans can keep an eye out for the full "Pink Moon."

The name "Worm Moon" may have come from the earthworms typically found as spring nears, according to The Old Farmer's Almanac. It also may date back to writings from the 1760s about worms, or beetle larvae, coming out from bark as trees thaw from the winter.

March's full moon also has the distinction of being the Lenten Moon, which comes before the spring equinox on March 20.Senator Bernie Sanders on new book, Social Security and the future of jobs

Social Security is heading for a funding cliff, with its trust fund reserves potentially becoming insolvent by 2033 — an outcome that would mean beneficiaries would face a 25% shave on their monthly checks. But there is a way to fix most of the funding shortfall, policy experts say: "Smash the cap."

That refers to the Social Security tax cap, a feature of the program since it was launched in the 1930s following the Great Depression. Essentially, any income over the earnings cap isn't subject to the Social Security payroll tax, which is 6.2% for workers and an additional 6.2% for employers.

In 2023, the tax cap stands at $160,200, which means any income above that amount is exempt from the payroll tax. As a result, middle- and lower-income workers bear a much greater tax burden in funding Social Security than the 6% of Americans who earn above the threshold, according a new analysis from the left-leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research.

"If you make over that cap, like 6% of the population does, you could be paying 1% of your income or even less than that," noted Sarah Rawlins, program associate at CEPR.

Yet a middle-income worker earning less than the $160,200 cap in 2023 will pay an effective tax rate that is six times higher than the millionaire's tax burden, she noted.

That's why the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), a federal agency that provides financial analyses of policy issues, calls the Social Security tax cap "regressive" — middle- and low-income workers pay a much greater share of their income toward the program than the rich.

Eliminating or lifting the tax cap could help stabilize Social Security's trust fund by providing more revenue to the program, Rawlins said. A December analysis by the CBO found that eliminating the cap for earnings over $250,000 would keep the trust fund solvent through 2046.

Meanwhile, some lawmakers are proposing changes that include both getting rid of the tax cap and other changes to address Social Security's funding challenges. Senator Bernie Sanders, an Independent from Vermont, and Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, in February introduced legislation that would stabilize the trust fund for the next 75 years.

Among their plans: Lift the tax cap for people earning $250,000, and add the Social Security tax to investment and business income, which is currently exempt from the tax.

Raise the retirement age?

Others oppose raising taxes on higher-income Americans as the answer to fixing Social Security. Last year, the Republican Study Committee, a group of House conservatives, proposed lifting the retirement age for claiming Social Security to age 70, up from today's full retirement age of 66 to 67 years old.

While House Speaker Kevin McCarthy has said Social Security won't be on the chopping block during the ongoing debt ceiling debate, pushing the retirement age higher isn't a new approach. For instance, the full retirement age was 65 until 1983, when changes to the program took into account the fact that Americans were living longer and the retirement age was raised to 66 or 67 (depending on one's birth year).

Americans' longer lifespans are part of the argument that Republican lawmakers make in favor of lifting the Social Security retirement age: the "miracle" of longer life expectancy means that workers can wait to get their benefits, according to Republican Study Committee's documents.

Regardless of whether people can actually work until they are 70, raising the retirement age is effectively a benefits cut because today's workers would lose out on between three and four years of benefits. Based on the average Social Security benefit for retirees, raising the retirement age to 70 would equate to a loss of at least $65,000 in payments for the typical beneficiary.

Still, with a divided Congress, for now it's unlikely that either the Democrats or Republicans could push through their changes to stabilize Social Security.Wife who lost husband to Alzheimer's wants to inspire other caregivers

Andover, Connecticut — Peter and Lisa Marshall's wedding day was unforgettable, according to Lisa. But her husband quickly forgot it.

"It's the saddest part because you want to reminisce, and you're alone in the memory," she told CBS News in 2021.

In 2018, Peter was diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's. Eventually, he not only forgot his wedding day, but he also forgot his wife. Lisa became just another nameless caretaker.

And yet, a whisper of their love must have remained — because all of a sudden, Lisa said, her husband started courting her, as if they'd just started dating.

One day, when a wedding scene came on TV, Peter pointed to the screen and said, "Let's do it."

"And I said, 'Do what?' And he pointed again. And I said, 'Do you want to get married?!' And he got this grin on his face and he said, 'Yeah.' So he fell in love with me again," Lisa said.

Lisa accepted his proposal. In 2021, she staged a wedding for her already husband.

"I can't even describe to you how magical it was. He was so present. And he was so happy. And it was very touching," she said.

Lisa said Peter hadn't been this lucid in weeks. But, it was a Cinderella moment. The clock struck midnight and by the next morning, their second wedding too was lost to the fog. But Lisa said she fully expected that.

"I'm the one who's going to remember that. And that's going to help me heal later," she said at the time.

Unfortunately, later came. Peter died about a year ago.

Lisa is now advocating for other Alzheimer's patients and their families. She has also written a book called, "Oh, Hello Alzheimer's."

"I wanted people to understand the devastation of the disease, but mostly, I want people to continue to find joy, and really focus on being present with their loved ones," she recently told CBS News.

Do that and, she says, Alzheimer's will never defeat you, it will just make your love all the more invincible.

Last year, according to the Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth, Topol's son Omar shared that his father had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, though his cause of death was not immediately known.

Topol's role of Tevye earned him a 1973 Oscar nomination for best lead actor, along with a Golden Globes win for best actor in a motion picture in the comedy or musical category.

Topol played the part of Tevye more than 3,500 times on-stage, and even most recently as 2009, according to the Associated Press.

Israeli President Isaac Herzog expressed his condolences at the actor's passing, calling him "one of the giants of Israeli culture."

מכנר על הגג ועד לגג העולם, חיים טופול שהלך מאיתנו היה מאמני הבמה הישראליים הבולטים, שחקן מחונן אשר כבש במות רבות בארץ ומעבר לים, מילא בנוכחותו את מסכי הקולנוע ובעיקר נכנס עמוק לליבנו. — יצחק הרצוג Isaac Herzog (@Isaac_Herzog) March 9, 2023

Herzog described Topol as "a gifted actor who conquered many stages in Israel and overseas, filled the cinema screens with his presence and above all entered deep into our hearts."

In 2015, Topol was awarded the Israel Prize for liftetime achievement, the highest cultural honor the state can bestow.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netayahu also expressed his condolences, writing on Twitter, "My wife Sarah and I, like all citizens of Israel, are saying goodbye today with deep pain to our beloved Haim Topol."

Netanyahu went on to call Topol a "versatile artist, with great charisma and energy" and "a huge heart."

רעייתי שרה ואני, ככל אזרחי ישראל, נפרדים היום בכאב עמוק מיקירנו חיים טופול – אהוב הקהל שהיה מגדולי אמניה של מדינת ישראל.



הוא היה מגדולי אוהביה של ארץ ישראל, ועם ישראל החזיר לו אהבה — Benjamin Netanyahu - בנימין נתניהו (@netanyahu) March 9, 2023

In 1991, Topol's reprisal of his role of Tevye in the Broadway production of "Fiddler on the Roof" earned him a Tony nomination for best actor in a musical.

Additionally, Topol won a Golden Globe for most promising newcomer for his role in the 1964 Israeli film, "Sallah."

He is also known for his roles in the early 1980s films, "Flash Gordon" and "For Your Eyes Only," and his ongoing philanthropic work as president of the Jordan River Village, a charity for sick Israeli children.

He is survived by his wife and three children, according to the BBC.The rise of AI: Could ChatGPT take your job?

Rapid advances in artificial intelligence-powered tools are quickly making large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI's ChatGPT a can't-live-without resource for many workers.

Executives are relying on the technology to consider different vantage points, real estate pros are using it to write listings and lawyers are using it to generate first drafts of documents like wills and more.

New research examining the effects of language modeling AI like ChatGPT on different occupations and industries finds that certain jobs, like telemarketers and teachers, are more "exposed" to the technology than others, such as psychologists and counselors.

According to the researchers, the term "exposed" has a fairly broad definition, indicating professions may be impacted by AI in a number of ways, ranging from job loss to the inclusion of the technology to assist in some job functions.

Telemarketers topped the list of the 20 most exposed occupations to language modeling AI tools. Postsecondary English language and literature teachers came next, followed by foreign language teachers. Postsecondary teachers of history and other disciplines followed. In fact, teachers claimed nine of the top 11 spots.

These are the 20 most exposed professions:

Telemarketers English language and literature teachers Foreign language and literature teachers History teachers Law teachers Philosophy and religion teachers Sociology teachers Political science teachers Criminal justice and law enforcement teachers Sociologists Social work teachers Psychology teachers Communications teachers Political scientists Cultural studies teachers Arbitrators, mediators and conciliators Judges, magistrate judges and magistrates Geography teachers Library science teachers Clinical, counseling and school psychologists

The legal services industry was found to be the field that's most exposed to language modeling AI tools. Artist and athlete management, travel agent services and grantmaking and giving services were also among the most exposed fields.

Job augmentation or substitution?

AI researchers from Princeton, the University of Pennsylvania and New York University used the AI Occupational Exposure (AIOE) measure to determine jobs' and industries' "exposure" to advances in AI, leaving open the question of whether that exposure leads to augmentation or substitution. They isolated language modeling AI capabilities to hone in on its potential effects on the economy, given ChatGPT's rapid rise in utilization and popularity.

"We went about it by breaking down occupations by the portfolio of abilities that they require. Different jobs have different skills that are important," Manav Raj, one of the researchers, told CBS MoneyWatch. "We took an ability-based perspective and measured exposure to advances in different applications of AI at the ability level."

The researchers took 10 common applications of AI, including image generation like the app DALL-E and language modeling, which powers ChatGPT, and mapped them to different occupations to see how related AI tools' abilities were to various job skills.

"Given the excitement around ChatGPT and language modeling technologies, we thought it would be interesting to isolate their effects," Raj said.

Job roles likely to change

As a researcher at a higher educational institution himself, Raj said professors at the University of Pennsylvania are considering how new AI technologies will affect the jobs they do, including how professors go about creating assignments for students.

"There are a lot of really interesting things you can do with ChatGPT, like use it to create a syllabus or suggest readings," he said.

To him, the overlap makes sense. "The actual abilities educators use on a day-to-day basis involves a lot of content creation and working with language, and that is what these technologies focus on — those abilities," he explained.

In other words, the nature of work is more likely to change in these occupations exposed to AI.

While in some cases AI will replace workers, in others it will complement their skills and free them up to perform higher-level tasks that boost productivity — and companies' bottom line. What remains unknown is what kinds of new jobs will be created as a result of emerging forms of AI.

"It's still unclear exactly what that change will look like," Raj said. "Maybe it will mean automation and maybe workers will be more productive by using these technologies."Elon Musk derided a disabled former Twitter employee after the worker said on the social media site that he wasn't sure if he still had a job.

The spat began when Haraldur Thorleifsson, who has muscular dystrophy and relies on a wheelchair, sent a tweet to Musk on Monday asking for clarity about his job status.

Thorleifsson, who lives in Iceland, noted he had lost access to his work computer several days ago, but that Twitter's human resource department hadn't confirmed his employment status. That kicked off a string of tweets between Musk and Thorleifsson, with the billionaire asking Thorleifsson about his role with the company.

After that exchange, Thorleifsson said a Twitter human resources employee emailed him and confirmed that he had been laid off, "which is totally OK and it happens all the time."

"Companies let people go," Thorleifsson wrote. "That's within their rights. They usually tell people about it, but that's seemingly the optional part at Twitter now."

Musk responded to a screenshot of the exchange between himself and Thorleifsson by criticizing the former employee, alleging that the man "did no actual work" and used his disability "as his excuse."

"The reality is that this guy (who is independently wealthy) did no actual work, claimed as his excuse that he had a disability that prevented him from typing, yet was simultaneously tweeting up a storm. Can't say I have a lot of respect for that," Musk wrote.

Hi again @elonmusk 👋



I hope you are well.



I’m fine too. I’m thankful for your interest in my health.



But since you mentioned it, I wanted to give you more info.



I have muscular dystrophy. It has many effects on my body.

Thorleifsson, the founder of a creative design agency he sold to Twitter in 2021, told the BBC he joined Twitter as a full-time employee as part of the acquisition and that his title was senior director in product design.

Musk added that Thorleifsson technically wasn't fired because "you can't be fired if you weren't working in the first place."

After news outlets wrote about Musk's comments, he said he video called Thorleifsson "to figure out what's real vs what I was told."

"Better to talk to people than communicate via tweet," Musk said.

Musk later apologized to Thorleifsson "for my misunderstanding of his situation."

"It was based on things I was told that were untrue or, in some cases, true, but not meaningful," Musk said.

The Twitter owner's brash management style, which has included firing thousands of employees at the social media platform, has drawn fire from former employees, lawmakers and management experts. The company is also being sued by unpaid vendors and for unpaid rent in office spaces it occupies in California.

Twitter's workforce has tumbled from about 7,500 employees shortly before Musk's purchase to about 2,000 as Musk has sought to cut costs.

Alex Sundby contributed reporting.Employers across the U.S. added 311,000 jobs in February, a sign the labor market remains solid even as the Federal Reserve tries to slow economic growth.

The figure, released Friday by the Department of Labor, was higher than economists' expectations that employers had added about 208,000 jobs last month, according to financial data company FactSet. The jobless rate edged up to 3.6%, from 3.4% in the prior month as more Americans looked for work.

Hiring was strong among employers in the leisure and hospitality, retail and health care industries, as well as for government jobs, the Labor Department said. The U.S. has an ongoing "scarce talent market" that is prompting employers to hire, noted Becky Frankiewicz, president of the recruiting company Manpower Group.

The "overall picture is one of job growth that remains well above the economy's long-term potential and is much too hot for the Federal Reserve," wrote PNC chief economist Gus Faucher in a report.

The latest payroll numbers mark a decline from January's unexpectedly strong hiring, when employers added 517,000 jobs, or more than twice the number that economists had expected.

The stronger-than-expected job growth underscores the battle ahead for the Fed, which over the past year has sharply raised interest rates in an effort to put the brakes on the economy. The tight job market and strong hiring may heighten the risk that high inflation could persist, spurring policy makers to speed up rate hikes.

As a result of February's jobs data, the central bank is likely to raise the federal funds rate by half a percentage point when it meets in two weeks, higher than the earlier expectation from economists that the Fed would raise rates by a quarter point, Faucher noted.

Back in the job hunt

More Americans are searching for work, helping to expand the labor market. About 419,000 people joined the job market in February compared with January, according to Faucher.

That helped lift the labor force participation rate — the share of working-age adults who are working or looking for a job — to the highest rate since the pandemic, at 62.5%. Still, participation remains lower than its pre-pandemic level of 63.3% as many adults remained sidelined by health issues, child care or other issues.

The average hiring rate of the past three months is 351,000, not far off the 400,000 three-month average recorded in 2022, noted Brian Coulton, chief economist of Fitch.

"[I]f job growth stays at this pace, labor market imbalances are not going to ease," Coulton noted.The rise of AI: Could ChatGPT take your job?

Microsoft is integrating ChatGPT-like capabilities into its meeting software, contributing to the user base that has made the AI-powered generative text tool the fastest-growing app of all time.

The tech company on Thursday introduced a "more intelligent" premium version of Microsoft Teams, its videoconferencing tool, powered by the same AI that runs ChatGPT. Chores that can now be performed by the tool include taking notes and bulleting key takeaways from meetings — work traditionally done by employees.

Microsoft has invested billions in OpenAI, the AI research company behind ChatGPT, betting on the company's lead role in AI breakthroughs that will transform the way professionals across numerous fields work.

The note-taking function is powered by OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model, the same model that powers ChatGPT.

In a blog post, Microsoft said that "modern tools powered by AI hold the promise to boost individual, team, and organizational-level productivity and fundamentally change how we work."

In Teams, ChatGPT will automatically provide recaps of meetings held over the platform, generate task lists based on discussion and provide meeting transcripts and summaries. Its "intelligent recap" feature will generate meeting notes, recommend tasks, and personalize highlights for individuals — whether they are in attendance or not. AI-generated chapters will organize meetings into sections, similar to divider slides in a presentation.

For a limited time, it costs $7 a month to use. The price will eventually rise to $10 a month per user, according to Microsoft.

The tool can also translate meetings into different languages in real time with captions for participants who don't know the language being spoken. That feature is available to all participants when the meeting organizer pays for a premium subscription.

Microsoft is billing the advanced technology as a way for organizations to cut costs and boost workers' productivity.

Microsoft also announced it will incorporate new generative AI functions into Viva Sales, its sales app. OpenAI's GPT-3.5 will generate email replies to businesses' customers to "give sellers a head start to keep the conversation moving to deal close," Microsoft said.

Concerns are swirling around what jobs ChatGPT could take away from humans as it demonstrates its ability to write coherent text based on virtually any prompt. Real estate professionals are using it to write listing descriptions, and business executives are using it to conduct research and to spot biases in their thinking and approaches to myriad challenges. The AI-bot even passed a law school exam and has authored legislation.A restaurant waiter at Charleston's Restaurant in Omaha, Nebraska, made a TikTok thanking singer-songwriter Jason Derulo for tipping him $5,000 — enough to pay for a semester at the waiter's college.

The waiter, Jordan Schaffer, posted the video Tuesday saying that serving the singer and Derulo's family will be something he never forgets, while expressing appreciation for the music star's generous actions.

"Hey Jason, thank you, you just paid for a semester of my college. I can't say thank you enough," Schaffer said in the video. "I hope you and your family have a wonderful time in Omaha, and I hope you see us again. Thank you so much."

Before ending the video, Schaffer showed his followers the receipt which had the hefty tip on it. The total bill, including the tip, amounted to $5,795.

Derulo commented under the video that Schaffer seemed "like a great person" and thanked him "for taking such great care of our fam. Keep spreading the love bro."

Derulo's gesture adds to a list of generous actions by the artist. In 2020, Derulo, along with actor Will Smith, surprised Aiden Yielding — a 14-year-old who had been undergoing chemotherapy for leukemia — with a virtual visit, according to CBS Texas.

At the time, Yielding's dad had garnered recognition from people around the world for his efforts to bring awareness to childhood cancer.Reddit plans to shut down its live audio conference platform, called Reddit Talk, in June less than two years after launching the feature to compete with Clubhouse.

Reddit said in a blog post this week that employees have been working behind the scenes to update the website and make it simpler for users. The original plan was to keep Talk operating by using staff from an outside company, while in-house Reddit employees worked on the revamp.

"Unfortunately, the 3rd party audio vendor we use for Talk is shutting down its service," Reddit said. "In other words, the resources required to keep Talk live during this transition increased substantially."

Reddit said it eventually plans to relaunch Talk, but noted "there's significant work we need to do — like making Reddit simpler and building better subreddit infrastructure — before incorporating audio."

Reddit users who wants to download the audio file of their Talk session can start doing so March 21, Reddit said. Talk sessions launched before September 1, 2022, will not be available for download.

Reddit launched its audio function hoping to capture some of the stardust from the rise in popularity of Clubhouse. Silicon Valley entrepreneurs Paul Davison and Rohan Seth launched the audio chat-housing platform in late 2019 with financial backing from prominent venture capital firms. The app caught fire during the pandemic as people stuck indoors searched for ways to connect with the outside world.

Clubhouse grew to more than 9.6 million global downloads by February 2021, according to TechCrunch. But Clubhouse's popularity has waned and now has about 200,000 monthly active users, Business Insider reported in November.

Reddit Talk, which launched in April 2021, is a separate feature on the website that lets users host audio conversations within a designated community. Similar to Clubhouse, Reddit Talk gives a user "moderator" status who can mute and unmute live users. Daily use of Reddit Talk grew 250% between late 2021 and early 2022.Epoch Everlasting Play said it is recalling 3.2 million of its popular Calico Critters toys following three incidents involving a bottle and pacifier accessory, including the deaths of two children.

The recalled toys include more than 50 types of flocked animal figurines and sets sold with the bottle and pacifier accessory, according to a notice posted by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) on its website. The bottle and pacifier pose a choking hazard to children, according to the agency.

The sets involved in the recall were sold at Walmart, Meijer and other stores across the U.S., as well as online at Amazon.com and at calicocritters.com. The toys were sold from January 2000 through December 2021 and retailed for between $10 and $80.

Dell Technologies is the most recent large high-tech company to announce a major layoff, with the hardware maker saying Monday it is slashing 5% of its workforce.

In a regulatory filing, Dell attributed the job cuts to a "challenging global economic environment." Dell Chief Operating Officer Jeff Clark told employees in a letter that the company's previous moves to reduce its costs "are no longer enough. We now have to make additional decisions to prepare for the road ahead."

The cuts amount to roughly 6,600 people, with Dell saying it has about 133,000 workers globally in its most recent annual report, filed January of last year. The company previously paused external hiring, limited travel and cut spending on outside services.

The cuts will be completed by the end of April, according to the filing.

Dell shares fell 3.6% on Monday after the cuts were announced and are down 31% of the last 12 months.

Over the last year, Dell has lost ground to other computer manufacturers. As of the fourth quarter of 2022, Dell had roughly 16% of the market for global PC sales, down from just over 18% a year earlier, according to IDC. That trails China's Lenovo, the No. 1 PC maker with 23% of the market, and No. 2 HP with nearly 20%.

In its most recent quarter, Dell reported net revenue of $24.7 billion, down 6% from $26.4 billion in the year-ago period. Its net income from continuing operations fell to $241 million, down 93% from $3.6 billion a year ago.

A number of large tech players, including Google-parent Alphabet, Amazon, IBM, Meta, Microsoft and Twitter have laid off tens of thousands of employees in recent months after expanding rapidly during the pandemic. So far this year, U.S. tech companies have announced 67,000 job cuts, according to the website Layoffs.fyi.

—Irina Ivanova contributed to this report.London — The official titles of Prince Harry and Meghan's son and daughter were updated on the U.K. royal family's website Thursday, a day after it was announced that the couple had christened their daughter Princess Lilibet Diana in California earlier this month. The two children are now listed as Prince Archie of Sussex and Princess Lilibet of Sussex on the royal family's line of succession, on which they are fifth and sixth in line to the throne.

"I can confirm that Princess Lilibet Diana was christened on Friday, March 3 by the Archbishop of Los Angeles, the Rev John Taylor," a spokesperson for the Sussexes said in a statement on Wednesday.

Lilibet was not a princess at birth because she was not a grandchild of the monarch. She gained the right to the title, however, when her grandfather King Charles III took the throne, according to rules set out by King George V in 1917.

The Wednesday announcement by the Sussexes was the first time Lilibet had been publicly called a princess. Both Lilibet and her brother Archie have been entitled to use HRH, or His or Her Royal Highness, and the prince and princess titles, under the 1917 rules, since Queen Elizabeth II died and Charles ascended the throne.

"The children's titles have been a birthright since their grandfather became Monarch," the Sussexes' Archewell organization affirmed in a statement on Thursday. "This matter has been settled for some time in alignment with Buckingham Palace."

CBS News understands that the the offer to update the royal website using the children's titles came around the time that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex learned they would be asked to vacate their royal residence in the U.K., Frogmore Cottage.The first GOP presidential contest is nearly a year away, but Iowa caucus season is officially underway, as presidential hopefuls and potential candidates travel to the Hawkeye State. And voters there are ready — and keeping their options open.

On Monday, former President Donald Trump will make his first visit to Iowa since he announced his campaign last year. This week, the only other major Republican in the race, former Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley held town halls in Council Bluffs and Nevada before heading to Des Moines for a foreign policy forum with Iowa GOP Sen. Joni Ernst.

On Friday, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis made an appearance in the state, too, as part of his book tour. In several private conversations with donors and allies, DeSantis has indicated he is leaning toward running and will make a final decision after his legislative session is over, according to two people familiar with his team's private discussions.

Over 1,000 attended DeSantis' interview-style event with Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds.

While Mr. Trump won Iowa in the 2016 and 2020 general elections, he's far from being the sure winner of the 2024 Iowa caucuses.

"It's an open field," influential Iowa Republican Bob Vander Plaats told CBS News correspondent Robert Costa. "There's a lot of Republicans who really liked what President Trump did and the Trump administration did, but there's a real pause. Is he the right one to carry the baton in 2024? Has America made up their mind about the former president?"

Vander Plaats, CEO of the socially conservative group The Family Leader, acknowledged that Trump has the advantage over other candidates for now.

"I think if the election were held today, President Trump would win," Vander Plaats said. "If Trump gets stalled here in Iowa or if he gets defeated here in Iowa, I think it is 'game on' for the nomination." He believes the narrower the field of candidates is, the more competitive a GOP primary will be.

Vander Plaats said he's hearing "from a lot of people" that they "want to turn the page [on] the former president."

A new Des Moines Register poll released Friday suggests Mr. Trump's support is eroding in Iowa. If he were to become the nominee, only 47% of Iowa Republicans said they would definitely support him in the general election. That's a double-digit drop from June 2021, when 69% said they would definitely support him.

That same poll also finds that while more than four in 10 Iowa Republicans have a very favorable view of Trump, roughly the same number have a very favorable view of DeSantis. Only 17% view former Vice President Mike Pence very favorably, while 16% view Haley, also a former governor of South Carolina, very favorably.

Speaking after appearing at the forum with Haley on Friday, Ernst said Republicans have a deep bench to choose from and are excited by it. Her advice to candidates is "get to know the people of Iowa and more importantly, let the people of Iowa get to know you."

Ernst said she has not spoken with Trump since he announced his 2024 run.

At Haley's town hall Wednesday, multiple attendees said they caucused for Trump in 2016 and 2020 – but are looking around at other candidates now.

"I'm gonna keep an open mind and listen to everybody that is declaring for the Republican Party," said Zach Rasmussen. He said he's impressed by Haley's experience as former U.N. ambassador.

Ruth Bitter said she supported Trump in the last election but may not in 2024.

"I'm concerned that if he's elected for president again that it will be the same battle between Democrats and Republicans," Bitter said. "I want to see action and not in the form of fighting."

Across the state, in Davenport on Friday, attendees at DeSantis' first visit to the state praised his record as Florida governor, specifically on education and his COVID-19 response.

CJ Ormsby, a Mason contractor from Bettendorf, said Trump is "uncontrollable as far as his communication style" and "always in a battle." He said while he hasn't made up his mind, he thinks DeSantis has a better way of communicating and would be more effective in the White House.

Trump is holding an event in Davenport on Monday, three days after DeSantis' stop, for an event to outline his education plan.

"There were times where I could understand why people would decide not to vote for Trump. But he's a businessman, our country is a business, and I think it needs to be run like a business, and with Biden and his posse, I'm really just heartbroken over it," said Anne Hanson of Eldridge, before doors opened at DeSantis' event.

"I'm here to figure that out," she said, when asked who she'd choose between Trump and DeSantis. She added she's also going to Trump's event on Monday and is "anxious" to see what happens.

Suzy Barker of North Liberty, donned a University of Florida sweatshirt when she went to see DeSantis speak in Davenport. If she had to cast her caucus vote today, she says she'd pick DeSantis.

"But there's a long way to go. And we're just starting to hear about candidates, but I'd like to hear what others have to say," she said.

While the Republican nominee has won Iowa in the general election in the past, the state has a lackluster record in picking the Republican presidential nominee. Republican Sen. Ted Cruz squeezed by Trump for a victory in the caucuses in 2016. Former Sen. Rick Santorum had a thin lead over Mitt Romney in 2012. Former Gov. Mike Huckabee won the caucuses in 2008 – while the eventual nominee, the late Sen. John McCain, came in fourth.

The last non-incumbent Republican to win the Iowa caucuses, GOP nomination and the White House was former President George W. Bush in 2000.

Vander Plaats said Iowans are looking for candidates to show the following traits ahead of the caucus: "Can we trust you? Are you ready for the job? And are you right for America at this time?"

Story County GOP Chair Brett Baker jokingly put it this way: "We have to shake somebody's hand three times before we can see ourselves voting for them for president."

He is staying neutral, but he noted while Trump has the name recognition, based on the events, people are showing up to see what others have to offer.Actor Robert Blake, whose decades-long film and television career was tarnished by a notorious murder trial, has died at the age of 89.

Blake died in Los Angeles, his niece Noreen confirmed to CBS News Thursday. She said he died after a battle with heart disease, adding that he "passed away peacefully with family and friends."

The Los Angeles County coroner's office told CBS News that it "did not have a report" about Blake's death.

"Due to his age and reported medical history his death may not fall under our jurisdiction," a statement from the coroner's office read.

Prior to being tried and acquitted in his wife's shooting death, Blake was best known for the 1970s television series "Baretta," for which he won a best actor Emmy in 1975, and his last screen role, the 1997 film "Lost Highway."

However, on May 4, 2001, Blake's wife, Bonny Lee Bakley, was shot and killed in Blake's car near a restaurant in the Studio City neighborhood of Los Angeles.

Blake was arrested on a murder charge in April 2002.

The case finally went to trial in late 2004, and Blake was acquitted by an L.A. jury in early 2005.

The jury of seven men and five women delivered the verdicts on its ninth day of deliberations, following a four-month trial with a cast of characters that included two Hollywood stuntmen who said Blake tried to hire them to kill his wife.

However, no eyewitnesses, blood or DNA evidence linked Blake to the crime. The murder weapon, found in a trash bin, could not be traced to Blake, and witnesses said the minuscule amounts of gunshot residue found on Blake's hands could have come from a different gun he said he carried for protection.

Blake had hundreds of film and television credits. His career began when he was a preschooler, with the role of Mickey in the 1930s and 1940s kids' comedy film series "Our Gang," which was re-run for decades on television.

He won critical acclaim for his portrayal of real-life killer Perry Smith in the 1967 film "In Cold Blood." In 1993, Blake won another Emmy as the title character in, "Judgment Day: The John List Story," portraying a soft-spoken, churchgoing man who murdered his wife and three children — also based on the true story of a convicted murderer.

He was born Michael James Gubitosi on Sept. 18, 1933, in Nutley, New Jersey. His father, an Italian immigrant and his mother, an Italian American, wanted their three children to succeed in show business. At age 2, Blake was performing with a brother and sister in a family vaudeville act called, "The Three Little Hillbillies."

When his parents moved the family to L.A., his mother found work for the kids as movie extras, and little Mickey Gubitosi was plucked from the crowd by producers who cast him in the "Our Gang" comedies. He appeared in the series for five years and changed his name to Bobby Blake.

He went on to work with Hollywood legends, playing the young John Garfield in "Humoresque" in 1946 and the little boy who sells Humphrey Bogart a crucial lottery ticket in "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre."

In adulthood, he landed serious movie roles. The biggest breakthrough was in 1967 with "In Cold Blood." Later there were films including, "Tell Them Willie Boy is Here" and "Electra Glide in Blue."

In 1961, Blake and actress Sondra Kerr married and had two children, Noah and Delinah. They divorced in 1983.

His fateful meeting with Bakley came in 1999 at a jazz club where he went to escape loneliness.

"Here I was, 67 or 68 years old. My life was on hold. My career was stalled out," he said in an interiew with The Associated Press. "I'd been alone for a long time."

When Bakley gave birth to a baby girl, she named Christian Brando — son of Marlon — as the father. But DNA tests pointed to Blake.

Blake first saw the little girl, named Rosie, when she was two months old and she became the focus of his life. He married Bakley because of the child.

"Rosie is my blood. Rosie is calling to me," he said. "I have no doubt that Rosie and I are going to walk off into the sunset together."

Prosecutors would claim that he planned to kill Bakley to get sole custody of the baby and tried to hire hitmen for the job. But evidence was muddled and a jury rejected that theory.

On her last night alive, Blake and his 44-year-old wife dined at a neighborhood restaurant, Vitello's. He claimed she was shot when he left her in the car and returned to the restaurant to retrieve a handgun he had inadvertently left behind. Police were initially baffled and Blake was not arrested until a year after the crime occurred.

Once a wealthy man, he spent millions on his defense and wound up living on social security and a Screen Actor's Guild pension.

In a 2006 interview with the AP a year after his acquittal, Blake said he hoped to restart his career.

"I'd like to give my best performance," he said. "I'd like to leave a legacy for Rosie about who I am. I'm not ready for a dog and fishing pole yet. I'd like to go to bed each night desperate to wake up each morning and create some magic."Spotify CEO explains issue of artists' pay, says it's "hard to change the narrative"

After years of criticism over how artists are paid through streaming, many people still think Spotify doesn't pay the artists who are featured on its platform fairly. CEO and founder Daniel Ek has been trying to clear that up.

"We don't pay artists directly," Ek told CBS News' Gayle King.

"[Artists] have their deals with their record companies and their deals with their publishers, et cetera," he said. "And what Spotify does is we pay out to those record companies and these publishers, and don't know what individual deals these artists may have."

Spotify created a website in 2021 called "Loud & Clear" to clarify exactly who receives payments. But Ek said he wishes he had handled the issue differently.

"It's a complex topic," he said. "But I wish I would've handled it up front. And it's very hard to change the narrative once that narrative has established itself."

"That's, I guess, the lesson learned from my side," he added.

Ek said when he started Spotify in 2006, his dream was to combine his favorite interests – technology, computers and music – into one platform. Spotify says it is now the music industry's No. 1 revenue generator, paying out more than $40 billion as of 2022. The platform also now has half a billion users.

Ek said it's been "an emotional roller coaster," adding, "it never stops."

"It's been the most gratifying thing I've ever done in my life besides my kids," he said, but noted, "it's not for the fainthearted."

Alongside the topic of artists' pay, Spotify has been criticized over issues related to content moderation. In 2020, the company announced an exclusive licensing deal with the No. 1 podcast in the world: "The Joe Rogan Experience," which has been a source of controversy for the company. Last year, 270 doctors wrote to Spotify about Rogan spreading misinformation about COVID-19.

Since then, Spotify has added a link to resources on COVID-19 on Rogan's episodes, and has taken down dozens of his episodes that don't meet their community guidelines.

But just last month, Rogan made a comment perpetuating an antisemitic stereotype, in an episode that is still up on the platform.

The CEO of the Anti-Defamation League called out Rogan, saying, "Disturbing that at a time of rising anti-Jewish violence, when growing numbers of Americans believe in antisemitic conspiracy theories, [Joe Rogan] would use his immense platform to spew antisemitic tropes about Jews and money."

Ek said he found the comment "highly offensive" but defended the company's practices.

"We have these guidelines where if people are subjecting other people to harm, we do take action," Ek said. "But, I think it is important that we are a place that allows a lot of diverse voices to be able to express themselves, to be able to communicate through art."

"There are a lot of things that I disagree with that Joe Rogan and lots of other voices are saying on our platform as well. But I come back to it: is this violating our terms of service or not? And if it is, then we take it down. And if you take antisemitic comments, we've taken down thousands of podcasts that have violated our platform rules."

"And in the broader context, it's probably hundreds of thousands of episodes that are violating other terms and services as well. So we do take that very seriously," he said.

Ek said he doesn't decide what gets removed and what stays, saying Spotify has experts and a Safety Advisory Council "that take those actions."

"I think it's really important that this isn't just a decision that's made by me," he said. "It is made by a diverse group of people too, with a varied perspective. … And the same rules apply to Joe Rogan as it would to any other podcaster."

Ek wouldn't say whether or not Rogan's contract will be renewed, amid reports that it is up at the end of the year.

"What I can say is the contract, I believe, has some more time to go than that. So we'll cross that bridge when we get to it," he said.

For now, Spotify is in the midst of a big change. At its Stream On event in Los Angeles Wednesday, Ek revealed major changes to the platform's user experience, including an "entirely new" home feed that is "completely redesigned from the ground up."

Ek said Spotify took inspiration from the evolution of social media and added a "unique Spotify twist."

"I don't want people to think that we're making this to be like TikTok," he said. "We're making it to be a much more interactive Spotify."

Ek said a big focus for him is simple: "You have to live in the future."

"And for me, the future is always the young people. What are they doing in various cultures?" he said. "Every few years in the industry someone brings something out from a design perspective that's just [a] much, much better way for people to interact with it."

Changes in Ek's industry extend beyond design, as companies embrace major developments in artificial intelligence.

Ek said AI technology does – and doesn't – scare him.

"On a broader scale it is kinda crazy to imagine what the world may look like in five or 10 years if we go to what people call AGI, artificial general intelligence," Ek said.

"Which basically means that you have an AI that might be smarter than any human alive, right?" he said. "So that's kind of daunting to think about, what the consequences might be for humanity, as we're there. And I think we have to be very careful about it."

"But at the same time, on the other side, it's also so obvious that AI can help so much by making, you know, both experiences better and easier for all of us to deal with," he said." And that's pretty much in every single field."Open Instagram, scroll, exit, repeat. Open Facebook, scroll, exit, repeat. Open Twitter, scroll, exit, repeat. Open TikTok...

For many of us, using social media has become a reflex — something we reach for when we wake up, before going to sleep or whenever we're bored.

But research shows social media can take a toll on mental health, which is why experts advocate for a balanced relationship with our doomscrolling devices.

"Social media can be great for connecting with friends, family and your community. However, it can also leave users... vulnerable to judgments and negative comments from the public," says Melissa Dowd, licensed marriage and family therapist and therapy lead at virtual health platform PlushCare.

But how do you know when you're in need of a social media break? Experts says to look for these signs:

It makes you feel bad: Just like in-person interactions, social media can impact our emotional health, both positively and negatively.

"When we are feeling bombarded with posts, comments or conversations that are not in alignment with our morals or values, that can negatively affect our emotional well-being," Dowd says.

"If you find going on social media is making you feel down or worse than you normally feel, that's definitely a sign for a break," says Alyssa Mairanz, a licensed mental health counselor and owner of Empower Your Mind Therapy.

It becomes a comparison game: "If you notice that you're doing a lot of comparing yourself with others that you see on social media, that's another sign for a break," Mairanz says.

In a world of filters and Photoshop, the pressure to appear perfect and fit a narrow beauty standard is "higher than ever," Dowd adds.

"While it can be fun and inspiring to follow along on others' journeys, it can also lead to harsh comparisons and feelings of shame or inadequacy," she says.

It takes up all your free time: "If you find social media is distracting you from spending time with loved ones in real life or altering how you prioritize your daily plans, it might be time to take a step," Dowd suggests.

How can you have a healthier relationship with social media?

Limit your scrolling: "It's important to limit your time reading the news and scrolling through social media. These activities can become not only time consuming, but it can drain your emotional energy," Dowd says.

She recommends limiting consumption to 30 minutes in the morning and at night and prioritizing self-care during the rest of your day.

"Try turning off your notifications on your personal devices," she suggests. "You can control what and when the info comes to you."

If limiting isn't enough, try taking a break altogether. A recent study found just three days off social media led to significant improvements in body image for teenage girls, CBS News Colorado reported.

Choose who you follow wisely: "Don't be afraid to set virtual boundaries," Dowd adds. "If the person or organization isn't someone or something you would choose to spend time around or associate with in-person, then it likely isn't the healthiest 'follow' choice."

Instead, choose to follow accounts that positively add to your life.

"This could mean supporting an organization's account that you feel passionate about or following a profile that offers you healthy new perspectives, uplifting and hopeful messages, a sense of community or some much needed humor throughout the day — those are all super healthy options to go with," she says.

Remember, not everything is real: In addition to filters and misinformation, social media tends to be a "highlight reel," showing off only the positive moments or, as Dowd describes, "most favorable aspects of their lives.Gloria Estefan is making history by becoming the first Hispanic woman to be inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame.

"To be the first of anything at this age is fantastic," Estefan told "CBS Mornings" on Wednesday.

For Estefan, songwriting appears to come naturally. She's sold over 100 million records worldwide, has garnered eight Grammy Awards and is the voice behind smash hits like "Anything for You" and "Rhythm is Gonna Get You."

Estefan said that creating music has never been easy for her but once she's been able to put her thoughts and emotions down, the words come easily.

"The minute I finish writing a song, I think I will never be able to do this again... Each one is different. Every song comes differently," she said.

By her side for the last 47 years is her husband, Emilio Estefan Gómez, a fellow musician and producer. Together the two are credited for paving the way for other Latin artists like Shakira and Ricky Martin and helping them crossover into mainstream pop.

Gloria Estefan CBS News

Estefan said that she and her husband became their own "cheerleaders" and took the industry head-on.

"And you know, we got a lot of no's at the beginning of our career. 'No, this sound will never work. No, you are not going to be able to crossover. No, you can't compete on a world level.' Of course, we didn't believe that," she said. "When we got the opportunity to give a hand up or leg up to other Latinos, other Latin artists that we knew could be amazing, it was wonderful to be able to say yes."

Estefan is among seven musical icons — including Sade, Glen Ballard, Snoop Dogg, Jeff Lynne, Teddy Riley and Liz Rose — to be announced as inductees into the 52nd Annual Songwriters Hall of Fame.

The star-studded event is slated for Thursday, June 15 at the Marriott Marquis Hotel in New York City.More than 9,000 California residents were under evacuation orders Friday as a new atmospheric river brought heavy rain, thunderstorms and strong winds, swelling rivers and creeks and flooding several major highways during the morning commute.

In Santa Cruz County, a creek bloated by rain destroyed a portion of Main Street in Soquel, a town of 10,000 people, isolating several neighborhoods.

Crews were working to remove trees and other debris and find a way for people to cross the creek, county officials said.

County authorities asked the town's residents to stay indoors. Heather Wingfield, a teacher who runs a small urban farm with her husband in Soquel, said she and her neighbors were, for the time being, trapped in their homes as Bates Creek rushed through what was once Main Street.

"It's horrible," she said. "Hopefully no one has a medical emergency."

Wingfield said her neighbors' water infrastructure was also washed out, but that her family's well would keep them with running water. She said the floods so far weren't impacting their farm, where families in the neighborhood pick pumpkins, squash and sunflowers every summer.

Wingfield said living near Soquel Creek has meant being aware there might be floods, but "never did I imagine it would wash out a culvert."

Evacuations were ordered in nearby Watsonville where creek water spilled over and filled roadways with several feet of water, threatening dozens of homes with flooding. At one home, chickens inside a backyard coop perched on a bar near the roof to avoid the water.

In some lower-elevation towns in Northern California, torrential rain was coming down on piles of snow.

"It already is stressing the buildings, and then when you start putting rainwater on top of it, especially heavy rains, that just further compounds the threat," El Dorado County Fire Protection District Chief Tim Cordero told CBS News Friday in Camino, a small town about 50 miles east of Sacramento.

The roof of a building directly across from the firehouse had been completely mangled by the snow.



On Thursday, a security camera captured footage of the roof of Ruth's Dolls and Memories, a Camino doll museum, collapsing completely. The owner, Marlene Ruth, was not inside at the time but told CBS News she had been building her collection since 1972.

"This is just stuff," Ruth said. "It's just stuff. It's not my life. But it would have killed me."

Meanwhile, the Folsom Dam in Sacramento County was releasing 30,000 cubic feet of water every second Friday to prevent flooding.

In Central California, the Tule River overflowed its banks and flooded several homes. Videos posted on social media showed a handful of homes and cars under a few feet of water and at least one road washed out in the town of Springville by the rushing river.

Several public parks, including the Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks, were closed to visitors due to the ongoing heavy rain.

In the San Francisco Bay Area, flooding blocked portions of several major highways, including Interstate 580 in Oakland, disrupting travel. And Peet's Coffee, a California-based chain, reported that after a heavy storm, an investigation is underway to determine the cause of a roof collapse that killed a worker at a distribution center leased by the company in Oakland.

The storm marked the state's 10th atmospheric river of the winter, storms that have brought enormous amounts of rain and snow to the state and helped lessen the drought conditions that had dragged on for three years. State reservoirs that had dipped to strikingly low levels are now well above the average for this time of year, prompting state officials to release water from dams to assist with flood control and make room for even more rain.

State transportation officials said Friday they removed so much snow from the roadways in February that it would be enough to fill the iconic Rose Bowl 100 times.

Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom has declared emergencies in 34 counties in recent weeks, and the Biden administration approved a presidential disaster declaration for some on Friday morning, a move that will bring more federal assistance into the state.

Emergency officials have warned people to stay off the roads if they can and to carefully heed flash flood warnings.

The atmospheric river, known as a "Pineapple Express" because it brought warm subtropical moisture across the Pacific from near Hawaii, was melting lower parts of the huge snowpack built in California's mountains. Snow levels in the Sierra Nevada, which provides about a third of the state's water supply, are more than 180% of the April 1 average, when it is historically at its peak.

The snowpack at high elevations is so massive it was expected to be able to absorb the rain, but snow below 4,000 feet could start to melt, potentially contributing to flooding, forecasters said.

In some lower elevation towns, the torrential rain came down on snow-covered roofs, CBS News correspondent Carter Evans reports.

"It already is stressing the buildings," El Dorado County Fire Chief Tim Cordero said. "And then when you start putting rainwater on top of it, especially heavy rains, that just further compounds the threat."

Lake Oroville — one of the most important reservoirs in the state and home to the nation's tallest dam — has so much water that officials on Friday planned to open the dam's spillways for the first time since April 2019. The reservoir's water has risen 180 feet since Dec. 1. Of the state's 17 major reservoirs, seven are still below their historical averages this year.

Despite record rainfall in January, Newsom worried it would stop raining and asked state water regulators to temporarily suspend some environmental rules to let the state take more water out of rivers and streams to store for later. But it has rained so much since then that on Thursday regulators rescinded their previous order to allow more water to stay in the rivers.

Forecasters warned that mountain travel could be difficult to impossible during the latest storm. At high elevations, the storm was predicted to dump heavy snow, as much as 8 feet over several days.

Yet another atmospheric river is already in the forecast for early next week. State climatologist Michael Anderson said a third appeared to be taking shape over the Pacific and possibly a fourth.

California appeared to be "well on its way to a fourth year of drought" before the early winter series of storms, Anderson said. "We're in a very different condition now," he added.

So much snow has fallen in the Sierra and other mountain ranges that residents are still struggling to dig out days after earlier storms.

On the far north coast, Humboldt County authorities organized an emergency response to feed starving cattle stranded by snow.

Cal Fire and U.S. Coast Guard helicopters began dropping hay bales to cattle in remote mountain fields last weekend, and then the California National Guard was called in to expand the effort.

"We've had some unprecedented weather over the last two weeks and we've received multiple reports of cattle dying off because ranchers cannot get to their cows due to impassable roadways," Sheriff William Honsal said. "These cattle are an economic driver, they're starving and they're calving right now. So all these things necessitate some drastic measures."George Mitchell's family owned a movie theater in Niantic, Connecticut, that they were forced to close after the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a significant decline in business.

"When the pandemic came, our business dropped to zero," Mitchell said. "It was the end."

But while COVID-19 dealt the final blow to some theaters like the Mitchells', streaming was already forcing a shift. Now, huge changes are underway in the film industry, as a writers strike looms and the business reckons with the impact of streaming services, as well as lingering effects of the pandemic.

This weekend will see the 95th edition of the Academy Awards, with films like "Everything, Everywhere All at Once" and "The Fabelmans" vying with blockbusters like "Top Gun: Maverick" for Best Picture.

But while the move industry pats itself on the back, ticket sales at the box office are down about 35% from pre-pandemic levels — which is unsustainable for smaller cinemas, said Matt Belloni, an entertainment journalist.

"The result after COVID is that we're seeing the box office concentrated in fewer movies, bigger grosses for the movies like 'Spider-Man: No Way Home,' 'Top Gun: Maverick,' 'Avatar: The Way of Water,'" Belloni said. "But it's that middle and lower tier that is really struggling still."

He said all of the top 10 movies at the box office last year were sequels or prequels, "and that is very disturbing to a lot of moviegoers who want these kinds of more adult, more serious movies to do well in theaters so studios have an incentive to put 'em there."

One such movie is "Dallas Buyers Club," a 2013 independent film that earned Matthew McConaughey the Best Actor Oscar and producer Rachel Winter a Best Picture nomination.

Winter said that streaming has made films that traditionally might have only gone into a handful of theaters more accessible to larger audiences.

"The good news is that with access to content and access to make content, there are lots more opportunities to tell different kinds of stories," Winter said.

But she still laments the downsizing of cinema.

"Look, I like being on my couch and in my pajamas and enjoying a movie," she said. "I enjoy that as much as the next person. But I will never stop wanting to go to the movies."Pfizer said Friday that the Food and Drug Administration has approved a new nasal spray to treat migraines.

Zavzpret, a branded formulation of the generic drug zavegepant, is the "first and only" calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonist nasal spray for treating migraines with or without an aura, or sensory disturbances such as flashes of light that can accompany a migraine, the drugmaker said.

Zavzpret began working to treat migraine symptoms in as little as 30 minutes and provided some relief for up to 48 hours after the last administered dose, Pfizer said, citing a March study published in The Lancet. A 10mg dose of the drug proved more effective than a placebo at relieving pain and other migraine symptoms, the study found.

Pfizer said it plans to make the drug available in pharmacies in July.

Angela Hwang, chief commercial officer and president of Pfizer's global biopharmaceuticals business, said in a statement that Zavzpret provides another option for the many people who suffer migraines.

Migraines are moderate or severe headaches that can cause a throbbing pain usually occurring on just one side of the head, according to John Hopkins Medicine. Other symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light and sound.

Migraines affect more than 10% of people globally, with people between the ages of 20 and 50 most likely to experience the condition, according to JAMA Network, an American Medical Association-published journal. They are the sixth-highest cause worldwide of years lost to disability, a measure of the amount of time individuals suffer from a lower quality of life due to a disability, according to the World Health Organization.

The global migraine drug market was worth $3.9 billion in 2021. Its value is expected to hit $5.4 billion by 2027, according to 2022 report from market research firm IMARC Group.Katja Rivera, 64, is a massage therapist and theater director in Berkeley, California, who said she's never earned more than about $30,000 a year. When her two daughters were small, she sometimes earned much less.

But Rivera was married for 10 years to a man who has consistently earned much more than she has. When Rivera retires in a few years, she expects to receive a Social Security check based on her ex's greater earnings.

Many divorced people don't realize they can get Social Security benefits derived from their ex-spouse's work history, said William Meyer, founder of Social Security Solutions, a website that helps people determine when and how to claim Social Security. Those who are aware of the benefits often misunderstand crucial details and can make decisions that cost them tens of thousands of dollars over their lifetimes, he said.

Here are the basics: You may qualify for benefits based on your ex's work record if your marriage lasted at least 10 years. Any benefit you receive won't affect the amounts your ex, your ex's current spouse or any of your ex's other ex-spouses will receive.

However, the rules for these benefits depend on whether your ex is alive or dead.

When your ex is alive: Divorced spousal benefits

If your ex is still alive and you haven't remarried, you may qualify for divorced spousal benefits. This benefit could be up to 50% of what the ex would get at full retirement age, which is currently between age 66 and 67.

You would get a divorced spousal benefit only if it's greater than the amount you've earned on your own work record when you apply. Social Security pays the higher of the two amounts — not both. Divorced spousal benefits end if you remarry.

To apply, you must be at least 62. Your ex must be at least 62 as well, or receiving Social Security disability benefits. If your ex is entitled to retirement benefits but hasn't started them, at least two years must have passed since the divorce for you to qualify for a divorced spousal benefit.

However, applying for Social Security too early has some significant costs. Your benefits are permanently reduced if you apply before your own full retirement age. Your payment also would be subject to the earnings test, which withholds $1 for each $2 you earn over a certain amount: For 2023, that number is $21,240.

Making the right choice is important because you can't switch from a divorced spousal benefit to your own benefit later — even if your own is eventually larger. (Your own retirement benefit can grow over time if you continue to work. In addition, you can earn "delayed retirement credits" that increase your retirement benefit by 8% for each year you put off applying, between your full retirement age and 70, when benefits max out.)

When your ex is dead: Divorced survivor benefits

If Rivera's ex dies before she does, she could be eligible for a different payment: divorced survivor benefits.

This benefit is more generous in many ways. The divorced survivor benefit can be up to 100% of what your ex was receiving. You can apply for this benefit as early as age 60, or age 50 if you're disabled. As with divorced spousal benefits, the amount will be reduced and subject to the earnings test if you start before your own full retirement age.

But you can be married and still get divorced survivor benefits based on an ex's work record, as long as you remarried at 60 or older. Plus, you can switch from a divorced survivor's benefit to your own benefit later. For example, you could start with a divorced survivor benefit as early as age 60 and then change to your own retirement benefit at 70, if it's larger.

You may need to call your ex

Rivera is confident that half of her ex's benefit amount will be more than her own, even if she waits to apply until her own retirement benefit maxes out at 70. To know for sure, though, she'd need to ask her ex to share his Social Security statement — something she's not comfortable doing.

You can easily check your own earnings record and projected benefit amounts by setting up a "my Social Security" account at www.ssa.gov. These figures can help you calculate how to maximize your benefit, using free claiming calculators like the one at AARP or more sophisticated paid calculators, such as Social Security Solutions (starting at $20) or Maximize My Social Security (starting at $39).

But you can't get similar access to an ex's record, Meyer notes. Without asking your ex to share their statement, you may not know how much your divorced benefits are worth until you actually apply. That can make it tough to plan ahead and maximize your lifetime Social Security income, Meyer said.

"Even though you may not want to call your ex, this may be the one time it's worth making a phone call," he said.Study finds quality sleep could add up to 5 years to your life

We know our sleep impacts our mental health and well-being, but a new survey is showing us just how much.

In its annual "Sleep in America" poll, released Thursday, the National Sleep Foundation found "strong associations between sleep health characteristics and depressive symptoms."

Half of all individuals who reported getting less than seven hours of sleep on weeknights said they experienced mild or greater levels of depressive symptoms, with 21% saying symptoms were moderate or severe.

And almost two-thirds (65%) of people who said they were dissatisfied with their sleep reported depressive symptoms; 31% said symptoms were moderate to severe.

The poll results come at a time the United States is dealing with a mental health crisis that was exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.

"As a licensed clinician, I'd say there's never been a more important time to think about the strong connection between our sleep and mental health," said Joseph Dzierzewski, vice president of research and scientific affairs at the National Sleep Foundation, in a news release about the survey.

The poll also found that nearly 2 in 5 people who have difficulty falling asleep (37%) or staying asleep (38%) just 2 days a week reported mild or greater levels of depressive symptoms.

In terms of positive correlations, over 90% of adults with good sleep health reported no or minimal depressive symptoms.

If you're someone who struggles with sleep, the NSF offers some tips for what you can do to improve your sleep, including:

Establishing a sleep routine

Avoiding screen time before bed



Creating a sleep-friendly environment



Getting light during the day, not at night



If you're still not getting enough restful sleep or you have lasting symptoms, the foundation advises talking with your health care provider.What factors are leading to a rise in crime?

A girl from Washington who went missing in 2018 has been found in Mexico, the FBI announced on Wednesday. Aranza Maria Ochoa Lopez was last seen with her biological mother at a mall in Vancouver, Washington, when she was 4 years old.

Lopez had a supervised visit with her mother the day she went missing, the FBI confirmed to CBS News. Her mother was arrested about one year later in Puebla, Mexico, but Lopez remained missing.

The FBI had offered a $10,000 reward for information leading to the recovery of Lopez. They worked with the Vancouver Police in Washington on the investigation, as well as law enforcement in Mexico.

Aranza Maria Ochoa Lopez was last seen with her biological mother at a mall in Vancouver, Washington, when she was 4 years old. She was found in February, the FBI announced this week. FBI

Mexican authorities found the girl in Michoacán, Mexico, in February, and she was escorted back to the U.S. by FBI special agents.

"For more than four years, the FBI and our partners did not give up on Aranza," said Richard A. Collodi, special agent in charge of the FBI's Seattle field office. "Our concern now will be supporting Aranza as she begins her reintegration into the U.S."

A representative for the FBI did not provide further information about Lopez's case. CBS News has also reached out to the Vancouver Police Department for further information.

During the supervised visit, Lopez's mother, Esmeralda Lopez-Lopez, asked to take her to the restroom at the mall, according to local publication The Columbian. She then fled with her daughter to a stolen vehicle and they left with an accomplice.

Lopez had been in foster care because of complaints that her mother abused her.

After being arrested in Mexico in 2019, Lopez-Lopez pleaded guilty in 2021 to second-degree kidnapping and robbery and first-degree custodial interference and she was sentenced to 20 months in prison, according to The Columbian.

Most abducted children are taken by family members, according to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.

If you're looking for a good rate for a high-yield savings account then consider using an online bank. Getty Images

If you're looking for a secure way to protect and grow your money a high-yield savings account can help. With recent interest rate hikes courtesy of the Federal Reserve, the appeal of these accounts has significantly increased in recent months, making now a great time to open a high-yield account.

High-yield savings accounts work similarly to traditional savings accounts except that they come with a much higher annual percentage yield (APY). Current rates for regular savings accounts are around 0.33% to 0.35% for the year but interest rates for high-yield savings accounts are exponentially higher, falling somewhere between 3.50% to 4.50% or more, depending on the lender and other factors. For just a $5,000 deposit that's the difference between earning $16.50 over twelve months versus $175.00.

But how do you find the highest rate for a high-yield savings account? That's what we will explain below. You can start researching rates to see how much more you could be earning here now.

How to get a good rate on a high-yield savings account

Here are two of the most reliable ways one can secure a high rate for a high-yield savings account:

Shop around

If you have the time and patience - and are committed to getting the highest interest rate out there - then shop around for an account before signing on the dotted line. There are many banks and credit unions that would be happy to have your business so don't open an account with the first lender that offers you a favorable rate. Look around and see if you can get something higher. If not, you can always circle back to the initial offer, although you should know that rates on high-yield accounts fluctuate and may not be identical day to day. That said, no one knows for sure where the rate environment is heading so you could see even higher rates in the future.

Either way, do your homework and look around before committing to one institution. And be sure to check for any maintenance fees or any other penalties that could potentially eat away at the interest your account should be earning. A high-interest rate account with pricey fees may not be as valuable as an account with a slightly lower interest rate that comes without any major penalties.

Start exploring your high-yield savings accounts options online now!

Consider an online bank

Because there are fewer costs involved with opening and maintaining an online banking institution these sorts of banks typically offer higher interest rates on high-yield savings accounts than banks with physical locations can. This isn't always the case but it's something to keep in mind as you search for the highest rate out there. Online banking institutions generally provide higher rates and lower fees than banks with physical locations (in fact, some of the more well-known banks may not even offer high-yield options at all).

There are two things to note about online high-yield savings accounts, though. You may not have easy access to an ATM to deposit or withdraw from your account, so calculate how much you can comfortably avoid using before funding the account. Also, because these are online you typically won't have an in-person resource to help with your account if there's an issue.

If those factors don't bother you and you're willing to go the online route then you'll likely secure a good rate than if you pursued an account at a physical location.

The sentencing of Paul Flores marks the culmination of a case that has drawn worldwide attention for over a quarter century. Flores, who had long been considered a prime suspect in Smart's death, was arrested in 2021 and found guilty of first-degree murder last October.

Smart was 19 years old when she vanished while returning to a dorm at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo. Flores was also a student at the school.

Smart's remains have never been found, but she was declared legally dead in 2002.

Prosecutors maintained that Flores, now 46, killed Smart during an attempted rape on May 25, 1996, in his dorm room at the university, where both were first-year students. He was the last person seen with Smart as he walked her home from an off-campus party.

Flores was arrested in 2021 along with his father, who was accused of helping to hide Smart's body.

The trial was held in Salinas, in Monterey County, about 110 miles north of San Luis Obispo, after the defense argued that the case's notoriety prevented Flores and his father from receiving a fair trial in their own county.

A jury found Flores guilty of first-degree murder in October. A separate jury acquitted Ruben Flores, 81, of being an accessory.

At Paul Flores' trial, defense attorney Robert Sanger tried to pin the killing on someone else. Sanger noted that Scott Peterson, who was later convicted at a sensational trial of murdering his pregnant wife and the fetus she was carrying, was also a student at the campus about 200 miles up the coast from Los Angeles.

Sanger filed motions on Feb. 24 in Monterey County Superior Court requesting that charges be dismissed and his client acquitted.

Sanger disputed forensic evidence offered by the prosecution. He contended that Flores' right to a fair trial was violated because of prosecution errors and "the admission of junk science as evidence."

"There is a reason that a case against Paul Flores was not brought for 25 years," the motion said. "There was no evidence of a murder or that Paul Flores committed it."

Paul Flores had long been considered a suspect in the killing. He had a black eye when investigators interviewed him. He told them he got it playing basketball with friends, who denied his account. He later changed his story to say he bumped his head while working on his car, according to court records.

Investigators conducted dozens of fruitless searches for Smart's body over two decades. In the past two years they turned their attention to Ruben Flores' home in the community of Arroyo Grande, about 12 miles south of California Polytechnic State.

The woman was rescued by deputies on Wednesday.

Abraham Bravo Segura did "intentionally and knowingly abduct" the victim, and held her in "a place where the Complainant was not likely to be found," court documents said.

During a probable cause hearing on Thursday, a Harris County prosecutor alleged the woman was "locked" in the boarded-up trailer for "approximately four years," according to courtroom video obtained by KTRK-TV.

While Segura was at work, the victim was able to call the police for help from inside the trailer in North Houston, according to KTRK.

All the trailer's exits were blocked with burglary bars on the windows, and Harris County Sheriff's deputies found three handguns inside, KTRK reported.

On Wednesday night, when authorities arrived at the trailers, bolt cutters didn't break through the boarded-up trailer, and the fire department had to use power tools to cut through the bars, the station reported.

At the hearing, Segura disagreed with the allegations against him and asked the hearing officer more than once "if he could defend himself," reported KTRK. He said the "story is one-sided."

Segura is in Harris County jail on a $150,000 bond, according to jail records. The bond conditions state he cannot have contact with the victim or family, and he would have to wear a GPS monitor upon his release, court records said.

His next court appearance is March 13.The artificial intelligence chatbot ChatGPT could soon be coming to your workplace.

The OpenAI technology, which has grown extremely popular since its release in November, will be rolled out in the professional messaging platform Slack, its parent company, SalesForce, announced Tuesday.

The ChatGPT app for Slack is currently in beta testing, and companies can join a waitlist to sign up for the beta version when it becomes available.

SalesForce said that ChatGPT "provides a conversational interface powered by OpenAI's large language models to get instant conversation summaries to stay informed, research tools to learn about any topic, and provide writing assistance to quickly draft messages."

SalesForce described the different skill sets the ChatGPT app for Slack will have, all intended to improve employee productivity. It will create AI-powered summaries of conversations in channels and threads. Employees will also be able to use ChatGPT to do research within Slack on any project or topic, SalesForce disclosed.

Slack users will also be able to use ChatGPT to draft up message replies, status updates and meeting notes.

OpenAI is itself a customer of Slack, and has been testing the ChatGPT app for the messaging platform, using it to "engage with their customers directly across sales, service, and engineering teams."

"There couldn't be a more natural fit," said Noah Desai Weiss, Slack's chief product officer, in a statement. "This will give customers new superpowers by helping them tap the collective knowledge of their organization's channel archives."

Slack becomes the latest in a series of companies to employ the OpenAI technology, including Snap, Quizlet, Instacart and Shopify.

Other tech companies have also launched artificial intelligence bots recently, including Microsoft's Bing-powered AI platform and Google's Bard.Results from a recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention survey add to the evidence that teen mental health is in crisis, with particularly concerning numbers surrounding teen girls.

The survey found around 1 in 3 high school girls in the U.S. have seriously considered attempting suicide and more than half of teen girls, 57%, reported feeling "persistently sad or hopeless" — a record high.

By contrast, 14% of high school boys told the 2021 survey that they had seriously considered attempting suicide, up from 13% in 2011.

Among LGBQ+ students, close to 70% said they experienced persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness during the past year, more than 50% had poor mental health during the past 30 days and almost 25% attempted suicide during the past year.

Alyssa Mairanz, a licensed mental health counselor and owner of Empower Your Mind Therapy, says the numbers are distressing, yet unfortunately, she "wasn't surprised."

"There are a few things that teens nowadays deal with that older generations didn't have to deal with," Mairanz notes, including social media, which can lead to harmful comparisons and online bullying, as well as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on developing minds.

So what can parents do to make sure their teens are OK?

Know the line between normal and not

"There's so many things that are typical with teens that aren't necessarily cause for concern, like general moodiness (and) fighting with parents," Mairanz says. "Parents don't know when it's cause for concern and what's more normal, so I think understanding that line is super important."

She says it may be a sign of something more serious if you see your teen...

is in intense, longer-lasting low moods

is becoming more isolated or withdrawn, including not wanting to socialize or see friends

is not wanting to get out of bed

is engaging in high risky behaviors, including physical aggression or intense substance use

Another sign that often goes under the radar? High perfectionism.

"A teen that's really setting these very high, unrealistic standards for themselves in terms of anything — could be grades, friends, looks," she says. "When it's really that high, it's definitely a warning sign. These can often lead to depression (and) suicidality."

Discussing the results of the recent survey on CBS News "Prime Time," Dr. Debra Houry, chief medical officer at the CDC, noted that changes in sleep and appetite can also be an indicator.

Listen and validate

"When parents are more validating to their child and focus on what they need versus what maybe the parent is assuming, teenagers tend to be much more open and willing to come to their parents when they're struggling," Mairanz says.

So, instead of opening a dialogue the intention to provide solutions, which may look like this:

Responding to an upset teenager with, "Oh it's fine," "It's not such a big deal" or "It's all going to be OK."

Or saying, "Let's talk about how we can study better" or "Let's create more intense notes" when a child does poorly on a test.

Mairanz suggests listening and validating, instead.

"Parents don't necessarily even realize how their response to their teenagers can have an impact. ... But a lot of times, the children really just need the emotional support. Because when they hear a solution, they hear, 'OK, I'm not doing enough,' rather than, 'OK, this is a struggle and it's understandable that you're upset.'"

Houry says being as "open and nonjudgmental as possible" can help a child feel more comfortable coming to their parent.

Keep an eye on social media usage

Parents should look out for a "real codependency" between their kid and their phones, which can look like being on social media and not taking breaks, Mairanz advises.

"Especially if it's impacting their ability to function, go to school, do their homework, be with friends… it's important to try to make sure teens get a break from all of that," she says.

Don't be a stranger to your child's circles

It's important not only to talk to your child, but to know your child's friends and their friends' parents, Houry says.

"That way you're able to have an open communication with families around you, build that support system and have a good sense of where your child is and what they're up to," she explains.

Don't ignore a child asking for help

If a child asks for professional help, don't brush it off. Experts say that's a sign to take action.

"Sometimes there's still a stigma around therapy, especially with parents because (they) want their children to be OK and they take it very personally when we're not," Mairanz explains. "It's unfortunately common for parents to be like, 'You're fine. This is just normal teenage stuff, you don't need help.'"

If a child isn't comfortable enough to ask for support, look out for signs they need professional help, including self-harm, increased substance use, withdrawing from school or a change in sociability.

Make sure you're OK too

While it's important to focus on the teen, Mairanz says it's also crucial for parents to realize they need to focus on themselves.

"Whether it has to do with their own mental health issues or specifically around parenting, kids pick up a lot - so if a parent is really struggling, it's important for them to deal with that," she says. "Know that part of helping your teen is also helping yourself."

The Justice Department, the city of Louisville and the LMPD have agreed in principle toward a consent degree, and Garland said the LMPD has made strides to improve its practices since then. Taylor, a Black woman, was fatally shot in her Louisville apartment in March 2020 when police officers forcefully entered her apartment during a botched raid. The Justice Department has charged multiple LMPD officers over her death.

"Shortly after we opened the investigation, an LMPD leader told the department, "Breonna Taylor was a symptom of problems that we have had for years.' The Justice Department's findings and the report that we are releasing today bear that out," Garland said during an announcement in Louisville.

The Justice Department report, Garland said, found that LMPD "uses excessive force" including neck restraints, conducts searches based on "invalid warrants," "unlawfully executes warrants" without first knocking and announcing, "discriminates" against Black people, and "discriminates" against people with behavioral health issues. The DOJ report, Garland said, also identified deficiencies in the police department's response to domestic violence and sexual assault calls. The DOJ also found LMPD has relied on traffic stops in Black neighborhoods, using a pretense of minor traffic offenses to investigate other potential crimes, Garland said.

"This conduct is unacceptable," Garland said. "It is heartbreaking. It errodes the community trust necessary for effective policing."

Garland said such practices and behavior are also an affront to the Louisville community, and to the "vast majority" of officers who put their lives on the line to serve the city with honor.

Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg, who assumed office earlier this year, along with the city's new police chief, issued a detailed response and said they will "do everything possible and everything necessary to correct the mistakes of the past and heal the wounds they've left in our community."

"You deserved better," Greenberg wrote. "We can and will do better. We are committed to putting reforms in place that will raise the department's standards and ensure constitutional and effective policing that reduces crime and improves public safety. ... This report paints a painful picture of LMPD's past. But it helps point us in the right direction for our future — and to the next phase in the process of police reform in Louisville. That phase begins now."

The Louisville Metro Police Department said they received the Justice Department report, and LMPD command staff will thoroughly review it.A gunman killed six people Thursday night at a Jehovah's Witnesses hall in the German city of Hamburg before apparently turning his gun on himself. The shooter was identified as a former member of the congregation, police said Friday. Four men, one woman and an unborn child were killed. Police initially said Friday that a pregnant woman had died in the attack, but they later confirmed she was among eight people wounded. Her 7-month-old fetus died.

Shots fired in a parish hall in #GroßBorstel #Alsterdorf led to a major operation yesterday.



According to initial findings, 8 people are seriously injured, 7 fatally, among them one unborn child.



Currently we announce the current state of the investigation at a #pressconference — Polizei Hamburg (@PolizeiHamburg) March 10, 2023

Police identified the gunman on Friday as unmarried former church member Phillip F., and said there was no indication of a terrorist motive. They said he left the church community about 18 months ago, "but apparently not on good terms."

Police had told CBS News previously that the shooter was inside the building the entire time and there was no manhunt at any point. When officers arrived, the shooter had already died by suicide.

The police did not give any indication of a suspected motive as they briefed journalists Friday morning about the shooting that stunned Germany's second-biggest city.

German magazine Der Spiegel first reported that the suspect was "said to have been a former member of Jehovah's Witnesses... between 30 and 40 years old."

Police confirmed Friday that the gunman used a semi-automatic pistol that he was licensed to own. They said there was an anonymous letter sent to the police force several years ago claiming the suspect was mentally unstable and had shown animosity for religious followers, and that a review of his firearms licensing was carried out.

They said when questioned, Phillip F. was cooperative and gave no indication of any mental health problems, so they closed the case. He was a sports marksman.

Mass shootings are rare in Europe, where gun ownership laws are generally much stricter than in many U.S. states. There is a long and strict process in Germany to obtain a permit for a handgun.

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, a former Hamburg mayor, described the shooting as "a brutal act of violence."

Investigators worked through the night to secure evidence. On Friday morning, forensic investigators in protective white suits could still be seen outside the building as a light snow fell. Officers placed yellow cones on the ground and windowsills to mark evidence.

David Semonian, a U.S.-based spokesman for Jehovah's Witnesses, told The Associated Press in an emailed statement early Friday that members "worldwide grieve for the victims of this traumatic event."

"The congregation elders in the local area are providing pastoral care for those affected by the event," he wrote. "We understand that the authorities are still investigating the details of this crime. We appreciate the courageous help provided by the police and emergency services."

Hamburg Mayor Peter Tschentscher tweeted that the news was "shocking" and offered his sympathy to the victims' relatives.

The scene of the shooting was the Jehovah's Witnesses' Kingdom Hall, a modern and boxy three-story building next to an auto repair shop.

Police spokesman Holger Vehren said police were alerted to the shooting about 9:15 p.m. and were on the scene quickly. On Friday morning, police confirmed they had received almost 50 emergency calls about the shooting.

Vehren said after officers arrived and found people with apparent gunshot wounds on the ground floor, they heard a shot from an upper floor and found a fatally wounded person upstairs who they suspected was a shooter. He said police did not have to use their firearms.

Student Laura Bauch, who lives nearby, said "there were about four periods of shooting," German news agency dpa reported. "There were always several shots in these periods, roughly at intervals of 20 seconds to a minute," she said.

Jehovah's Witnesses are part of an international church, founded in the United States in the 19th century and headquartered in Warwick, New York. It claims a worldwide membership of about 8.7 million, with about 170,000 in Germany.

Members are known for their evangelistic efforts that include knocking on doors and distributing literature in public squares. The denomination's distinctive practices include a refusal to bear arms, receive blood transfusions, salute a national flag or participate in secular government.

CBS News' Anna Noryskiewicz in Berlin contributed to this report.The Food and Drug Administration has recently announced recalls of several eye drop brands over concerns they could cause bacterial infections, with potentially devastating health consequences including blindness.

Millions of consumers use nonprescription, over-the-counter drops daily as a remedy for dryness, irritation and other mild eye conditions. But the flurry of recalls is leaving some regular users of the products wondering, are they safe? Here's what you should know.

Which brands of drops have been recalled?



EzriCare and Delsam Pharma "Artificial Tears Lubricant Eye Drops." Global Pharma Healthcare on February 2 recalled all lots of its EzriCare and Delsam Pharma brands of "Artificial Tears Lubricant Eye Drops," which it said could be contaminated with bacteria.

The recall came after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) began an investigation of a cluster of multistate bacterial infections it believed were associated with the tear drops. At the time of the recall, there were 55 reports of adverse reactions to the drops, including eye infections, permanent vision loss and one death from a bloodstream infection.

Global Pharma Healthcare said in a a statement that consumers who use the contaminated eye drops could go blind.

Customers have been advised to immediately stop using the drops.

Delsam Pharma "Artificial Eye Ointment." Global Pharma on February 24 also recalled one batch of a product distributed by Delsam Pharma,"Artificial Eye Ointment," again due to possible microbial contamination.

The company said that using the contaminated ointment could lead to infections that cause blindness, though it has not received any reports of injuries related to the product.

Apotex "Brimonidine Tartrate Ophthalmic Solution, 0.15%." Another manufacturer, Apotex, on March 1 recalled six lots of its own brand of glaucoma drops, called "Brimonidine Tartrate Ophthalmic Solution, 0.15%," which is for patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.

The company said it initiated the recall "out of an abundance of caution" over concerns that cracks in some of the units' caps could compromise the drops' sterility and lead to infection.

An Apotex spokesperson said the company has observed four bottles with cracked caps and that there have been no reports of negative health outcomes related to the product.

Pharmedica "Purely Soothing, 15% MSM Drops." Pharmaceutical firm Pharmedica USA on March recalled two lots of "Purely Soothing, 15% MSM Drops," also over sterility concerns.

Pharmedica warned that patients who use the contaminated eye drops can risk going blind, but the company said it has not received any reports of infection or illness related to its product.

How were problems with eye drops first detected?

According to the Associated Press, a patient in Los Angeles County, California, who had seen an ophthalmologist in the spring of 2022 developed an eye infection. Local health officials identified several more cases in subsequent months, with patients reporting eyes inflamed with heavy yellow pus that obscured most of the pupil.

The hospital that reported the first infection determined it was caused by a bacteria called Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which can cause infections in the blood, lungs or other parts of the body. The institution also determined the bacteria is resistant to many antibiotics.

Over the course of the year, other states received multiple reports of drug-resistant Pseudomonas, including a report of a Washington man who died after suffering bloodstream infection linked to over-the-counter eye drops.

In January, testing confirmed the Florida cases were caused by the same bacteria strain as cases in California, Connecticut and Utah. On January 20, the CDC told doctors to avoid recommending the EzriCare product.

What are the risks?

As of March 1, the CDC has identified 64 patients across 13 states with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Health officials said the outbreak is linked to using artificial tears. Eight patients reported vision loss and one person has died, according to the CDC.

The people who were sickened most commonly reported using EzriCare brand eye drops, while some patients used multiple brands.

Eye drops can cause infections in other parts of the body because the eye connects to the nasal cavity through the tear ducts and germs can move from the nasal cavity into the lungs.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which occurs naturally in the environment, can spread to humans who are exposed to contaminated water or soil. Pseudomonas aeruginosa can spread from one person to another through contaminated hands, equipment or surfaces, according to the CDC. Drug-resistant strains of the bacteria cause more than 30,000 infections annually among hospitalized patients in the U.S. and more than 2,500 deaths.

What if I use the recalled drops?

The CDC and FDA urge patients to immediately stop using the recalled eye drops — even if they haven't experienced an adverse reaction.

Patients who have previously used potentially unsafe products should contact their doctors and ask for a safe substitute.

When should I see a doctor for testing or treatment?

Patients who have used recalled eye drops should assess if they have any of the following symptoms commonly associated with eye infections:

Discharge from the eye

Eye pain or discomfort

Redness of the eye or eyelid

Feeling something in the eye

Increased sensitivity to light

Blurry vision

Patients with any signs of infection should immediately contact their health care provider for evaluation and treatment. Patients without symptoms do not need to undergo testing.

Are my eye drops safe?

Over-the-counter medical products aren't as closely regulated as prescription drugs, noted CBS News medical contributor Dr. David Agus.

"There's not much testing of safety on any of these things, so when something comes out it's because there were complaints, or in this case a drug-resistant bacteria was linked to a bunch of cases," he told CBS MoneyWatch.

As far as products and brands that remain on the market and are not under recall, he advised patients to "stick to the big brands that you trust." He also urged consumers to consider whether they really need to use eye drops.

"Ask your eye doctor whether you really need them," Agus said. "If we don't really need something, then we probably shouldn't be using it. If it's not a real problem — maybe we have a tiny bit of dryness — we probably shouldn't be putting something into our eye," he said.

"We used to have very prominent boy bands and girl groups, such as New Kids on the Block, Spice Girls, One Direction. I think K-pop really hits kind of a vacuum that Western pop cultural trends left behind," she said.

Pogue asked Kevin Woo, "What are the odds they would be able to recite every lyric, do every dance move?"

"Hundred percent," Woo replied. "They know it better than I do!"

Woo is a K-pop star (a K-pop idol, to use the technical term) who spent nine years in a group called UKISS. "Sometimes it gets dangerous at K-pop concerts, because they're so passionate," Woo said.

All successful bands have fans. But in K-pop, the fan-to-idol relationship is more reciprocal. Kim said, "Fans are extremely dedicated, but they also expect a lot in return from [an] idol."

According to the band INI, a pop idol never declines a fan interaction.

Pogue asked, "Is there ever a time when you don't want a selfie? Like, when you're trying to shop or see a movie?"

"No," replied one INI member. "Selfies are, like, a good opportunity for us to communicate with our fans."

If you're chosen, you'll spend up to ten years in South Korea's K-pop training centers, operated by the entertainment companies. "It's kind of like a boot camp," said Woo. "You go to your acting class, you go to your singing class, you go to your dance class."

Your appearance will also be managed: "You get camera tested every angle, hair and makeup. They change up different hairstyles, different colors," Woo said.

Pogue asked, "Is there a dark side to it?"

"When there's a good side, there's always going to be a bad side," Woo said.

Amber Liu is a former member of the girl group f(x). "I went to Korea, and I was around, like, 130 pounds. But I dropped to, I think, 95 at one point."

In 2020, after a series of suicides among K-pop performers, including Liu's former f(x) bandmate Sulli, she went public with her account of those grueling, extremely competitive training camps, where thousands of kids vie to get into a handful of groups.

"You're also thinking, like, 'Everybody's doing it, too. It's part of this, it's normal to us to feel like we're always hungry, to always feel exhausted,'" Liu said.

"And you're 15?"

"Yeah!" she said. "It was a pressure of success."

Angela Killoren, the CEO of CJ ENM America, the entertainment company that puts on the KCON conferences, said that while the training camps may sound intense to Americans, that kind of competitive pressure pervades Korean culture. "I'm not sure that it's unique to K-pop. It's a societal thing in Korea. There is a lot of pressure on doing well in school. They're all up 'til whatever time at night, like, studying, doing the work. There is this idea of wanting to do your best, and not disappoint others."

One thing is for sure: The South Korean music-making system does produce hits. Last year alone, the K-pop industry generated more than $5 billion, and four K-pop albums hit #1 on the Billboard list ("Oddinary" and "Maxident" by Stray Kids; "Proof" by BTS; and "Born Pink" by Blackpink).

According to idol Kevin Woo, that's no surprise at all: "Once you listen to K-pop, you're in for a treat," he said. "I mean, it's a very different culture out there. But I feel like once you listen to the first 30 seconds, you'll fall in love. Yeah, I promise you!"

The 65th Grammy Awards will be presented on Sunday, February 5, and will be broadcast live on CBS and on demand via Paramount+ beginning at 7 p.m. ET.

See also:When you were growing up, the closest you ever got to a personal medical data-collection device was probably a thermometer, or a bathroom scale. But these days, health trackers are a lot more sophisticated – and a lot more wearable.

Smartwatches from companies like Fitbit and Apple are teeming with tiny sensors that display their findings on your smartphone. They can track heart rate, irregular heartbeats, blood oxygen levels, noise notifications, and even hand-washing. And, of course, your pulse rate.

CBS News

Dr. Sumbul Desai, vice president of health at Apple, demonstrated to correspondent David Pogue how an Apple Watch can warn you about dangerous sound levels, measure your cardio fitness, and even perform an electrocardiogram.

"And if you want to choose to share this with your doctor, you can hit 'export to PDF,'" she said.

CBS News

But the most life-changing talent of the latest smartwatches is brand new: They can give you early warning of medical problems. "For example, if you're sleeping more or sleeping less than you used to, if your heart rate is at a different baseline heart rate than it was, those are early signs of things that may be going on," Desai said.

Pogue asked, "Without my having to check anything, it will actually tell me if it discovers something alarming?"

"It will. Another one is walking steadiness, which is, if we notice changes in your gait, we can actually give you an early notification where you can do something about it."

Then there's atrial fibrillation. It's a heart condition where your heart quivers instead of beating. As many as 6 million Americans have it, often resulting in a stroke. Trouble is, the episodes are intermittent, so a doctor might miss it at your checkup. But the watch is with you all the time. "Our watch can detect if your heart is beating out of rhythm, and will surface up a notification," Desai said.

CBS News

"Has this feature saved any lives?"

"Almost every day. Their physicians are actually telling them, 'I'm so glad you showed up when you did because this really could've ended much differently.'"

Stanford School of Medicine professor Michael Snyder is conducting several studies to see how far wearables can go in detecting disease. "You don't drive your car around without a dashboard," he said. "Yet, here we are as people. We're more important than cars, but we're running around without any sensors, most people. And we should be wearing these things, in my opinion, because they can alert you to early things."

When asked what conditions a smartwatch might be able to detect one day, Snyder replied, "Infectious disease, anemia, even type II diabetes. And then in the future, I'm pretty confident there's other things, for sure, heart conditions. We're working to see if we can detect cancer right now."

Snyder got a taste of his own smartwatch medicine last month. On the day of a cross-country flight, he felt congested. His own research app alerted him of sudden changes in his breathing and heart rates: "So, I did a COVID test, and it turns out I was negative. So, I went ahead and got on the plane. Big mistake."

He did have COVID. "I listened to my COVID tests, and I should've listened to my smartwatch," he said.

And sure enough, in a Fitbit study involving 100,000 people, those metabolic changes predicted COVID three days before any symptoms appeared.

CBS News

Now, at the moment, Snyder's app can't tell what is causing your vital signs to go screwy. "Right now, we can't tell the difference between certain kinds of stressors, like workplace stress and mental stress vs. COVID," he said. "But in the future, we will."

University of Cambridge professor Gina Neff is the co-author of a book about self-tracking, and overall, she's a fan.

MIT Press

"I am here to say that these data are great," she told Pogue. "People who self-track are more likely to be connected to other people, and when they're connected to other people, they're more likely to be happier."

But she does worry about who gets to see our medical data. "Imagine devices that are being used in warehouses, to determine if someone is moving fast enough," she said. "Imagine devices that you sign up for to help train you to be a safer driver, but it's instead used to raise your insurance premiums. These are scenarios that are used in companies today."

At least Apple and Fitbit say that they can't see your data. According to Desai, "Apple does not have access to any health information for a user. It is on the device, encrypted, and in the user's control."

"You don't have some engineer that could look up David Pogue's blood oxygen level?"

"Absolutely not."

For Stanford's Michael Snyder, the promise of disease detection on your wrist is a goal well worth pursuing: "Three-point-eight people on the planet have a smartphone, but if you can pair that with a $50 smartwatch, you'd have a health monitoring system for 3.8 billion people. I think we're just at the tip of the iceberg on what's possible."

Story produced by Amol Mhatre. Editor: Mike Levine.Amid the growing crisis in youth mental health services, Cherry Creek School District in Greenwood Village, Colorado, is trying something new: constructing a new building that will be part mental health medical facility, part school.

The district teamed up with the University of Colorado and Children's Hospital Colorado to use $15 million in public bond money to build this first-of-its-kind facility.

"For me, it's bigger than academics. It's understanding that our kids need us. Our kids need us to be there for them," Christopher Smith, the district's superintendent, said. "Kids need us to be there right now. If they feel loved, they feel invested in, they feel valued, they won't hurt themselves and they won't hurt others."

Cherry Creek School Superintendent Christopher Smith believes the facility, called Traverse Academy, will not just help children with their social and emotional learning but also engage them and address their educational needs. It will serve as both a school and treatment facility to help children transition back into day-to-day life.

University of Colorado's Department of Psychiatry professor Bruno Anthony says the approach hasn't been tried before anywhere in the country.

Something different

Traverse Academy was the brainchild of Dr. Tony Poole, assistant superintendent of special populations for the Cherry Creek School District.

"I've just seen the adolescent mental health crisis in Colorado get worse and worse and worse," said Dr. Poole. "To the extent that we really needed to do something as a school district. Something different, he said. When they couldn't find what they were looking for in the community, he said, "the best answer we could come up with was to build our own."

Poole gave CBS News a tour of the facility, still under construction. When finished, it will be a unique, first-in-the-nation combination mental health treatment center/hospital and transitional school.

"We designed the facility to be non-institutional," said Poole. "We want this to be a place that kids enjoy being in and feel welcome and supported."

When complete the facility will be divided into three sections: a full-time day treatment facility for acute mental health care, an area with less intense mental health services where educational instruction will be introduced, and an entire wing where the students will focus on their education while also receiving mental health services.

"What's unique about it is that it will have different levels of therapies in one place. What's exciting is that it will be integrated into a more educational context so it will be easier for the children to go back to the classroom," Anthony said.

In all, officials say most young people will only spend a few weeks in each of the three parts of the facility before going back to school in a traditional setting full-time.

Anthony says that in the past medical and educational experts tended to stay in separate and specialized silos and that many school districts can't afford to provide intense mental health treatment required to address their students in crisis.

"What happened in Cherry Creek is probably what happens in a lot of other school districts around the country," said Anthony. "They [the district] really don't have the resources necessarily always to deal with kids with serious emotional issues. So, what do they do? They look outside of the school for help in placing kids so that they can have more intense mental health treatment."

Anthony says this new combined facility of treatment center and school has, not only has the potential to provide a cost-effective alternative to hospitalization, but also a way to decrease depression and anxiety among participants because the setting is not a typical clinical medical facility.

Schools in need

Traverse Academy is a result of a commitment to mental health by the citizens of Greenwood Village.

But CBS News Investigations found that most other schools districts struggle to provide basic therapy and counseling.

According to the National Association of School Psychologists, in order for the nation to meet current demand, schools will need to more than double the number of psychologists on staff.

And data from the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP) shows 79% of the nation, 41 states, have a "severe" shortage of child psychiatrists.

Every other state, according to the AACAP, has a shortage of therapists. Only the District of Columbia has what the AACAP says is enough specialists to meet the need there.

Poole admits that because this approach has never been tried there could be some setbacks and challenges that others can learn from.

"This can be a model not only for the state of Colorado, but for the nation," said Poole. "And this can be part of the answer" to addressing the child mental health crisis.

Poole and Superintendent Smith agree that money can be an issue for some school districts. This new facility required the passage of a $15 million dollar bond by voters in the community to build.

Smith says it's all about priorities.

"I believe you can't be successful if you don't have significant priorities. If everything is a priority, nothing is," said Smith. "And so, yeah, absolutely, priority is number one" for this facility and for addressing youth mental health.

In his 34 years in education, Poole echoed Anthony, saying educators and medical professionals have always tended to stay in their own lanes.

"We always have felt we don't do clinical level therapeutic intervention. We are not a mental health facility. We are educators," Poole said. "If you have to have hospitalization or medical care, therapeutic or clinical interventions you go to a hospital or day treatment facility. That attitude has to change."

"I think unfortunately, the crisis that we have come into has led us to breaking down those barriers," said Poole.

"No one is used to this kind of thinking. It just has always been siloed." Poole said. "This facility will save lives. This is important, and this can be a model for others."

Currently, Cherry Creek runs a Sources of Strength project to increase well-being for all students by developing resiliency and a sense of belonging. The program also created an therapy class open to anyone in the school.

Calling the issue of child mental health "the most pressing issue facing our state and our country," Dr. Michele Lueck, executive director of Partners for Children's Mental Health, said her organization wants to make mental health more accessible to more children in Colorado.

Partners for Children's Mental Health is a non-profit formed in 2017 by the University of Colorado and Children's Hospital Colorado to help streamline and formalize specific programs to address the youth mental health crisis.

One of the programs they came up with is the youth advisory group which offers input, perspective and guidance to adults in leadership at the hospital to better meet young people where they are in crisis.

Each month the youth advisory group meets to provide hospital staff direct input into the mental health crisis affecting the youth in the area. The advisory group consists of high school students and young people who've been recognized as leaders in their community, some of whom have gone through their own mental health struggles.

"If we don't do a better job of creating environments where kids can grow and learn and be successful and thrive socially and emotionally, we are not doing our job for the next generation," Lueck said.

The advisory group gathers in person or via remote video conferencing to share their experiences and suggestions for best practices and input on what works and what doesn't work when approaching youth who struggle with mental health challenges.

"Our theory is that if we work with those kids who are at risk but have not ended up in the emergency room, have not sort of tipped the scales to make that into a crisis event," said Lueck, "we can work on real active prevention with those kids."

To get a sense of how the program works, Lueck's team allowed CBS News to observe on one group advisory session to see how the program works and how the advisor's input speaks to the states of mind many of their peers are experiencing.

We listened as one student advisor spoke of the COVID pandemic's effect on her mental health,

"It felt like a fever dream," Vanessa said. "Not really being able to go out or see friends or do anything, it just felt like the same day, like repeating over and over again, which really it took a toll on me after a while."

CBS News is only using the first names of former patients to protect their privacy.

Vanessa, an Asian-American teenager, spoke about the stigma surrounding mental health issues in some cultures.

"In a lot of different Asian cultures, mental health or struggles are not really emphasized as much as it is in Western cultures," Vanessa said. "That's just a huge indicator of the kind of silencing that happens in a lot of families because of stigmas like this. It's not just kids who need to learn more about mental health. It's also adults and the people who are the most afraid of it."

During the session we heard from another youth advisor named Kaitlyn, who said she felt disconnected during the pandemic.

"I did start feeling some more serious symptoms like loneliness and disconnect between some of my peer support networks and my friends," Kaitlyn said. "I'm like, I need to have some people around me."

Cydnee, another youth advisor, talked about lack of awareness among adults, "for me, my school, my teachers are not really equipped to actually deal with mental health."

As for sharing their feelings with teachers or school officials, Rachel, a high schooler admitted "It's hard to really open up and discuss what's really going on."

Lueck says the advisory group's input has already shaped the way adults overseeing mental health at the hospital make decisions and approach individual young people in crisis.

But Lueck says everyone from doctors to nurses, therapists to teachers, students to residents, must do even more.

"It's a crisis situation. And so, I don't think that we can do enough," said Lueck. "Schools have to do their part. Behavioral health care systems need to do their part. Hospitals and primary care doctors need to do their part. But you and I need to do our parts. We need to think about what we can do in our neighborhoods."

There are more than 600 local NAMI organizations and affiliates across the country, many of which offer free support and education programs.Vinyl records are back and more popular than ever. A new report found that vinyl record sales continued their more than decade-long growth in 2022, and for the first time in more than three decades, outsold CDs in the number of units.

The report, published by the Recording Industry Association of America on Thursday, found that physical formats of music saw another year of overall growth in 2022, totaling $1.7 billion. Making up nearly three-quarters of that growth were vinyl records, which saw a 17% increase in revenues for $1.2 billion. This marked the product's 16th year of consecutive growth, RIAA said.

It also marked the first time since 1987 that more vinyl records were sold than CDs, which saw a revenue decline of 18% in 2022. The group said that 41 million vinyl albums were sold last year, compared to 33 million CDs.

But physical copies continued to do better than digital downloads, which once again saw a decline in revenues. Digital downloads were once a stronghold of the industry, having once made up 43% of recorded music revenues in 2012. But 10 years later, that makeup has dropped to just 3%, the report found.

Even still, it was an overall positive year for recorded music, growing about 6% from 2021 to nearly $16 billion in retail and $10.3 billion in wholesale.

In a post on Medium, RIAA Chairman and CEO Mitch Glazier said that last year's numbers show that vinyl is "cementing its role as a fixture of the modern music marketplace."

"Music lovers clearly can't get enough of the high-quality sound and tangible connection to artists vinyl delivers," Glazier said, "and labels have squarely met that demand with a steady stream of exclusives, special reissues, and beautifully crafted packages and discs."

Revenues from physical music formats show that vinyl record sales brought in more money to the industry than CDs in 2022. Recording Industry Association of AmericaSmart home technology is more popular than ever. The U.S. smart home market is expected to be worth nearly $50 billion by 2026, according to Mordor Intelligence. Smart light bulbs, assistants, and thermostats can make life more convenient and save on energy bills, although the upfront costs can be more than quadruple their non-web-connected counterparts. Installing and maintaining smart security systems can also save consumers money by cutting up to 13% from homeowners insurance premiums, according to NerdWallet.

Smart home security systems are designed to be easy to set up right out of the box, even if you're not a tech expert.

"There are many companies, many products, and it really has been a race to make them very easy for the average consumer to pick them up, go home, plug them in, and have them connected," says Jason Hiner, editor-in-chief of ZDNet.

But there are a few important security tips to keep in mind:

Create strong passwords

Change any default device passwords, and make sure email or commerce accounts that control the devices are strong, too.

"A lot of times the password to log into the router will be like admin and password 123 or something very simple," says Hiner. "You want to make sure you change that. That's super important otherwise somebody could quite easily hack into your system potentially."

A 12-16 character password is best. Use a phrase or scramble significant dates, such as a pet's birthday, by putting the month, date, and year in an unusual order.

Keep your home Wi-Fi secure

Keep your smart devices on the main house account, and don't let visitors on it. Many Wi-Fi routers allow for the creation of a guest account, with a separate username and password to connect to the internet. When visitors connect to your main Wi-Fi, they carry your network information with them on their devices potentially compromising the safety of your network.

"If they go to an internet cafe, every one of your friends, family, and neighbors that you connect to your Wi-Fi then is potentially broadcasting your security, your very sensitive sensitive security information, everywhere they go," says Hiner.

Be mindful of the WiFi-enabled devices connected to the internet

Many new household appliances, from faucets to InstantPots and microwaves, are Wi-Fi-enabled. But Hiner says just because something can connect to the internet, doesn't mean you should do it, especially if you're unlikely to control it through a connected app.

"If you're not gonna actually use it in any way, or it's not going to be helpful in any way, don't connect it — because everything that's connected is potentially something that could be attacked," Hiner says. "If it has a vulnerability or it has a default password that you're not even aware of, then that can become a way for someone to attack your network and potentially compromise everything else."At 3 months old, even future kings of the savannah like to play.

In Senegal, a video of three cubs that would have hardly been imaginable a few years ago has given hope that the revered West African lion, which has been decimated over time, will be revived.

The U.S.-based wild cat conservation organization Panthera has released never-before-seen images of a lioness and three cubs spotted in February by a remote camera in the Niokolo-Koba National Park in southeastern Senegal.

In what Panthera describes as a "thrilling sign of recovery for the critically endangered West African lion," the video footage shows the big cat eating an animal carcass while her 3-month-old offspring try to imitate.

They brandish their claws and fangs, testing them out on scraps of wood or their mother's hindquarters.

"This documentation of new lion life... indicates the remarkable recovery of a population on the brink of extinction", the organization said in a statement.

Panthera has since 2011 been working with Senegal's Department of National Parks on conservation efforts in the Niokolo-Koba park.

In that time, the number of lions in the park has risen from 10 or 15 to around 30, the organization said.

The West African lion is characterized by a narrow mane and bald appearance, and is genetically distinct from the African or Asian subspecies.

There are between 120 and 375 of them left, according to Panthera.

Revered to the point of being cited in the Senegalese national anthem, West African lions have been decimated by poaching and the gradual loss of their habitat.

Their historic range has shrunk by 99%, Panthera said, citing the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

Florence, the lioness caught on camera, who is thought to be nine or 10 years old, has contributed to the population's recovery.

"When the history of Niokolo Koba's recovery is written, this moment will mark a turning point and Florence above all others will likely be recognized as the critical driver of West African lion recovery in one of this big cat's last strongholds," said regional director Dr. Philipp Henschel said in a statement.

The cubs — two males and a female — pictured with her are believed to be her third litter since 2021.

Panthera said last year a lioness was spotted with porcupine quills in her face, which prevented her from feeding. Scientists and a veterinarian anesthetized the animal and removed the quills, "providing the young female with a second chance at life," the organization said.

According to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, the population of lions in Africa continues to decrease. A 2015 study warned that lion populations in West, Central and East Africa could decline by as much as half by 2035.Washington — The House voted unanimously Friday on a bill ordering the declassification of intelligence about the origins of COVID-19 in China, sending the bill to President Biden's desk.

The bill, which already passed the Senate, would require Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines to declassify any information about links between the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic and the Wuhan Institute of Virology, the controversial viral research laboratory in the city where the SARS-CoV-2 virus first emerged. The vote in the House was 419 to 0.

White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre did not directly answer whether the president would sign the legislation, saying, "We're taking a look at the bill."

The intelligence community has not definitively agreed on the origins of the pandemic. A report in 2021 reflecting the findings of intelligence community was inconclusive, and determined two theories were "plausible" to explain how the virus emerged: "natural exposure to an infected animal and a laboratory-associated incident." The Department of Energy recently concluded, with "low confidence," that it was plausible that the virus originated from a lab, a theory supported by the FBI.

The Senate passed the GOP-crafted bill by unanimous consent last week. The bill was introduced by GOP Sens. Josh Hawley and Mike Braun.

The issue of the origin of the coronavirus has become fiercely politicized on Capitol Hill, with many Republicans using the increased consideration of the lab leak theory to criticize Dr. Anthony Fauci, the former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, for his support of the theory that the virus emerged in a Wuhan market where live animals were sold.

"Now the American people will be able to see what their government knows about COVID origins — and those who lied about it can be held accountable," Hawley tweeted after the bill passed Friday. "Next stop for my COVID origins bill, Joe Biden's desk. Sign it."

Democrats also expressed support for releasing information related to origins of the leak, as evidenced by their lack of objections in the House and Senate.

"Understanding the root causes of the COVID-19 pandemic is important to help prevent a future pandemic," Democratic Rep. Raul Ruiz, a doctor and ranking member of the Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic, said in a statement after the bill's passage. "Under President Biden's direction and leadership, the intelligence community has been hard at work gathering information to answer the question of whether COVID-19 started as a lab leak or animal transmission. The evidence, as of today, is inconclusive. It is important that the American people have as much objective information as possible without extreme partisan rhetoric."Davenport, Iowa — Ahead of a widely expected presidential campaign, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis introduced himself to an eager audience of Iowa Republicans on Friday with a message that leaned into the antagonism toward the left that has made him a popular figure among conservatives.

"We will never surrender to the woke mob," he said at the Rhythm City Casino Resort in the eastern Iowa city of Davenport. "Our state is where the woke mob goes to die."

With the Iowa caucuses less than a year away, Republicans in the state are taking a harder look at DeSantis, who is emerging as a leading rival to Donald Trump. The former president, who is mounting his third bid for the White House, will be in Davenport on Monday as early signs warn that some Republicans may be looking for someone else to lead the party into the future.

DeSantis appeared alongside Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds and was heading to the capital city of Des Moines later in the day to meet with a small contingent of GOP lawmakers and to promote his newly released book, "The Courage to be Free."

The visit is an early test of DeSantis' support in the state that will kick off the contest for the Republican nomination next year. A new Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa poll shows many Iowa Republicans remain committed to Trump, but the former president is seeing his support erode as campaigning begins to heat up. Trump's favorability numbers put him about on par with DeSantis, and they're substantially higher than those for Haley and potential candidate Mike Pence.

The poll's movement suggests Iowa Republicans are not singularly committed to Trump for 2024 and are open to considering other candidates. Though slightly behind the well-known Trump, DeSantis gets a rosy review from Iowa Republicans — 74% view him favorably. Notably, DeSantis has high name recognition in a state over 1,000 miles away from his own; just 20% say they aren't sure how to rate him.

Sandy Bodine said she was impressed with DeSantis as the ballroom emptied out after Friday's morning event.

"He's very articulate, uses common sense it seems in governing," the retired human resources worker for 3M Co. said.

Bodine would consider attending the 2024 caucuses and supporting DeSantis, though she is registered to neither major political party and has never caucuses before. Regardless, Trump is out of the running for Bodine, who is from nearby Clinton.

"I don't like Trump," she said. She "unfortunately" voted for President Biden in 2020, she said. "He's not a statesman and we need a statesman. I can see DeSantis as a statesman."

But others in the crowd suggested they would stick with the former president. Retiree Al Greenfield, of Davenport, said he came out of curiosity but "I don't particularly care for" the Florida governor. "He doesn't have the experience," said Greenfield, who's 70. "He doesn't know the swamp."

Greenfield is ardently for Trump and plans to caucus for him next year.

Nearby stood Diana Otterman, of Bettendorf, who was still considering her options.

"Gov. DeSantis is a wonderful man. I'm for DeSantis, but I'm also for Trump. I haven't decided yet," the 70-year-old retiree said. "So we'll see how God works it out and how the people vote."

While DeSantis was making his presence known in Iowa, several prominent former Trump supporters called on him to take the next step and announce he's running.

"More than ever our country needs strong leadership, someone that gets things done & isn't afraid to stand up for what's right," tweeted former Pennsylvania Rep. and Republican gubernatorial candidate Lou Barletta. "Come on, Ron, your country needs you!"

Barletta had accused Trump of disloyalty after the former president endorsed a rival in his gubernatorial primary.

DeSantis' visit coincided with a trip to the state by former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley, who announced her 2024 candidacy last month. Trump's stop on Monday will be his first visit to the state since launching his latest presidential bid.

In recent weeks, DeSantis' team has begun holding conversations with a handful of prospective campaign staffers in key states. Late last month, he gathered privately with donors, elected officials and national conservative activists to discuss his views, which include limiting how race and sexuality are taught in schools.

DeSantis is expected to announce his candidacy in late spring or early summer, after the conclusion of the Florida legislative session in mid-May.

The anticipation is reminiscent, to an extent, of the support in Iowa for George W. Bush ahead of the 2000 election, though with significant differences, said veteran Iowa GOP activist David Oman.

DeSantis is seen, as Bush was, as a next-generation, big-state Republican governor who won reelection resoundingly, said Oman, who was among Iowa Republicans who helped recruit Bush to run.

Bush swooped into Iowa amid fanfare in June 1999 and sailed to victory in the Iowa caucuses the following year en route to the 2000 GOP nomination and the White House. Not insignificantly, Bush enjoyed the hands-on campaign outreach in Iowa of his father, former President George H. W. Bush, who had built lasting relationships during his 1980 and 1988 Iowa caucus campaigns.

"There's another former president in this cycle. Only he is not interested in helping a first time candidate," Oman said, referring to Trump. "W was the overwhelming favorite in Iowa. I believe there is not an overwhelming favorite this time."

Another "atmospheric river" is expected to dump more rain and snow on parts of California this week — and it's not the first time this type of weather phenomenon has brought dangerous flooding conditions to the state.

What is an atmospheric river and why are they repeatedly in the forecast for the West Coast?

What are atmospheric rivers?

Atmospheric rivers are long regions in the atmosphere that transport water. The water vapor they carry is roughly equivalent to the average flow of water at the mouth of the Mississippi River, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. So, when they make landfall and release all that water, they can cause extreme flooding.

They are an important part of the world's water cycle, often contributing to water supplies, NOAA points out.

"They are extremely important to the water supply in the western United States and are part of the earth's ocean water cycle," The Weather Channel meteorologist Jacqui Jeras told CBS News. "The snowpack in the mountains in particular is important for drought relief and filling reservoirs. It's like saving up money in the bank during these events to be spent in the spring when the snow melts and fills the reservoirs."

How destructive are they?

In 2009, an atmospheric river that hit northwest Britain carried about 4,500 times the amount of water than the River Thames in London, causing extreme flooding in the area, according to a 2013 study by the University of Reading and the University of Iowa.

A 1998 study by MIT found an atmospheric river can have the same moisture flux as the Amazon River — carrying about 176,000 tons of water per second.

What are the atmospheric river categories?

The United States Geological Survey says high-intensity atmospheric rivers can be as destructive as hurricanes. Similar to hurricanes, these storms have a rating system — but their ratings incorporate the idea that they can be beneficial, hazardous or both.

The ratings range from Category 1 to Category 5, with the higher numbers indicating an escalating level of hazard. USGS explains:

Category 1 (weak): A Category 1 atmospheric river would be a milder and briefer weather event with primarily beneficial effects, like 24 hours of modest rainfall.

Category 2 (moderate): A Category 2 atmospheric river is a moderate storm with mostly beneficial effects, but also somewhat hazardous.

Category 3 (strong): A Category 3 atmospheric river is more powerful and longer lasting, with a balance of beneficial and hazardous impacts. For example, a storm in this category could bring 5-10 inches of rain over 36 hours, enough to help replenish reservoirs but also pushing some rivers close to flood stage.



Category 4 (extreme): A Category 4 atmospheric river is mostly hazardous, though also with some beneficial aspects. A storm of this rating could dump enough heavy rain over several days to bring many rivers to flood stage.

Category 5 (exceptional): A Category 5 atmospheric river is primarily hazardous. The USGS gives the example of an atmospheric river that lasted over 100 hours over the Central California coast during the 1996-97 New Year's holiday period. The heavy rain and runoff caused over $100 billion in damage.

In addition to flooding, the heavy rain from atmospheric rivers can also cause landslides, and strong winds can knock over trees and power lines.

Not all atmospheric rivers cause damage, and they can bring necessary rain or snow to enhance water supplies and build up much-needed snowpack in the mountains, according to NOAA.

How common are atmospheric rivers, and where do they happen?

There are typically between three to seven atmospheric rivers present in the world at any given time — and they're not just on the West Coast of the U.S., according to The Weather Channel.

In 2015, an atmospheric river that was more than 5,000 miles long accompanied a massive Atlantic storm that caused widespread flooding in the U.K., Ireland and Norway.

A 2013 study by the University of Reading and the University of Iowa found the phenomenon may become more common in the U.K. and cause more severe winter flooding. Atmospheric rivers are expected to become increasingly frequent and more severe climate change, the researchers say.

In 2010, an atmospheric river fed into a storm taking aim at the U.S. Mid-Atlantic states, resulting in a "snowmageddon," The Weather Channel reported.

And it says atmospheric rivers often make the rainy season in China, known as Mei-Yu season, even worse.

A well-known atmospheric river is the "Pineapple Express" — this is the system that brings moisture from Hawaii over to the West Coast of the mainland U.S.

In the Sierra Nevada, atmospheric rivers are 2.5 times more likely to result in destructive "rain-on-snow" events — when rain falls on snowpack and freezes — than other types of winter storms, according to a study by NASA.

"Atmospheric rivers can happen almost anywhere across the globe, but are most notable in the United States across the West," Jeras said.

And while just 17% of storms on the West Coast are caused by atmospheric rivers, they contribute to 30% to 50% of California's precipitation. They also contribute to 40% of Sierra snowpack, and more than 80% of the state's major floods, the NASA study found.

Atmospheric rivers are predictable and can sometimes be forecast up to a week in advance, says The Weather Channel. Similar to using hurricane-hunter aircraft to track hurricanes, Scripps Institution of Oceanography can drop sensors into atmospheric rivers to collect data on them.

"It is not uncommon to have multiple ARs every winter. The rain and snow pack we've had so far in the West will not bust the drought, but it is a good start," Jeras said, adding that while there can be devastating impacts from these storms, "we need the snow to keep coming in the mountains and to stay frozen until the spring to bring a more substantial impact."The off-season looks different for Colin Kaepernick. The former San Francisco 49ers quarterback is a new father, is involved in various media projects, runs a publishing company, and is the man behind "The Colin Kaepernick Foundation," a nonprofit that aims to empower Black and Brown youth.

He is also the author of a just-released book titled, "Colin Kaepernick: Change the Game," which he co-wrote with Eve L. Ewing, a professor and sociologist at the University of Chicago.

Geared toward young adults, the graphic novel reveals the early years of Kaepernick's life before he became a professional athlete and made headlines by taking a knee during the national anthem, sparking a movement within the NFL to protest police brutality and racial injustice.

"You know, very similar to the messaging of the book is I don't have control over all of these situations. But I control how I respond to it, I control how I prepare for it, and I'm a believer that in doing that, good things will happen," he said.

Kaepernick said he has always been and still is a relatively introverted person. He said his personality helps him navigate the world through tough times like when he said he faced resistance from people, including his White adoptive parents, when he tried to embrace his blackness.

Despite their love for him, Kaepernick said he encountered challenging situations which led him to understand the importance of sharing that racism can occur within one's own household.

"I know my parents loved me, but there were still very problematic things that I went through. I think it was important to show, 'No, this can happen in your own home.' And how do we move forward collectively while addressing the racism that is being perpetuated," he said.

Kaepernick was known in high school for his baseball skills. The pitcher even had major league interest, but he bucked public pressure and followed his heart to the gridiron.

"There were a lot more Black people in football. I was like, 'Oh, I found some community here,'" he said.

Kaepernick began his professional football career in 2011 when he was drafted by the San Francisco 49ers, where he helped lead the 49ers to the Super Bowl in his first year as a starter.

But his career came to a halt when he decided to kneel during the national anthem in protest against police brutality and racial injustice in 2016. Since then, he has not played in the NFL, and he has become an activist and advocate for social justice issues. He said his upcoming Netflix documentary with director Spike Lee will go into more detail about why he decided to protest that way.

In 2017, Colin Kaepernick sued the NFL, accusing team owners of colluding to keep him out of the league due to his protests during the national anthem. They later settled and he hasn't played since.

Kaepernick, now 35, said that despite how much time has passed and how busy he keeps himself, he looks forward to the day he can make his return to the turf.

"Five, six days a week I'm still up at 4:30, I go get my training in. Yeah, that passion is still there and the ability is still there," he said.Daylight savings is almost upon us, which means a lot of Americans are about to become even more sleep deprived than usual. But you don't have to be one of them. Being intentional about your sleep schedule as we prepare to "spring forward" an hour can help ease the transition.

On the second Sunday of March, at 2 a.m., clocks in most of the United States and many other countries move forward one hour and stay there for nearly eight months of daylight saving time.

"After the time change, waking up can be difficult — especially for kids and teens," said Jennifer Martin, a licensed clinical psychologist and president of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM), in a news release. "Planning ahead and adjusting your sleep schedule before the change to daylight saving time can help your body adapt and reduce the negative effects of the time change."

Ahead of the change, the AASM shared some tips to make the time change a bit smoother:

1. Get on a schedule

"Often we think of bedtime routines as being for toddlers, but I would say this week more than any other, prioritize that bedtime routine," Dr. Erin Flynn-Evans, sleep expert and consultant to the AASM, told CBS News.

With extra light in the evening once the time changes, it can drive us to stay awake later — but to the detriment of our sleep schedule.

"Our bodies are going to want us to sleep in later relative to the clock after this, so if we don't go to bed early enough to allow for a full night of sleep, we're just going to be sort of chronically sleep deprived on top of the shift that we're experiencing," Flynn-Evans explains.

2. Use the power of light

Exposure to light helps regulate sleep and alertness.

"Light is what tells our body clock or circadian rhythm what time it is," explains Flynn-Evans. "So by maximizing morning light and minimizing evening light, you should help your internal clock better adjust to this disruption that we force on ourselves twice a year."

For example, the AASM suggests heading outdoors for early morning sunlight the week after the time change. Flynn-Evans says you can also get a head start on waking up a bit earlier in the next few days by keeping the shades and curtains open for some natural morning light.

3. Maintain overall good sleep habits

To minimize fatigue and sleepiness around the spring time change, AASM advises getting at least seven hours of sleep per night before and after we put our clocks forward.

To help adjust to the shift, the organization suggests shifting sleep and wake times 15 to 20 minutes earlier each night starting a few nights before the time change. Or, set your clocks ahead one hour in the early evening on March 11 and go to bed at your normal bedtime that evening.

To help get into the new rhythm, "adjust the timing of daily routines that are 'time cues' for your body, such as your mealtimes," the organization adds.Judy Heumann, a renowned activist who helped secure legislation protecting the rights of disabled people, has died at age 75.

News of her death Saturday in Washington, D.C., was posted on her website and social media accounts and confirmed to The Associated Press by her youngest brother, Rick Heumann.

He said she had been in the hospital a week and had heart issues that may have been the result of something known as post-polio syndrome, related to a childhood infection that was so severe that she spent several months in an iron lung and lost her ability to walk at age 2.

She spent the rest of her life fighting, first to get access for herself and then for others, her brother recalled.

"It wasn't about glory for my sister or anything like that at all. It was always about how could she make things better for other people," he said, adding that the family drew solace from the tributes that poured in on Twitter from dignitaries and past presidents like Bill Clinton and Barack Obama.

President Joe Biden recalled working with Heumann, who he called a "trailblazer," to advocate for disability rights.

"Judy Heumann was a trailblazer – a rolling warrior – for disability rights in America," Mr. Biden said in a statement. "After her school principal said she couldn't enter kindergarten because she was using a wheelchair, Judy dedicated the rest of her life to fighting for the inherent dignity of people with disabilities."



Heumann has been called the "mother of the disability rights movement" for her longtime advocacy on behalf of disabled people through protests and legal action, her website says.

She lobbied for legislation that eventually led to the federal Americans with Disabilities Act, Individuals with Disabilities Education Act and the Rehabilitation Act. She served as the assistant secretary of the U.S. Office of Special Education and Rehabilitation Services, beginning in 1993 in the Clinton administration, until 2001.

Mr. Biden called those pieces of legislation, "landmark achievements that increased access to education, the workplace, housing, and more for people with disabilities," adding that Heumann "also served in leadership positions in two presidential administrations, and she started multiple disability advocacy organizations that continue to benefit people here and around the world."

Heumann also was involved in the passage of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which was ratified in May 2008.

She helped found the Berkley Center for Independent Living, the Independent Living Movement and the World Institute on Disability and served on the boards of several related organizations including the American Association of People with Disabilities, the Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund, Humanity and Inclusion and the United States International Council on Disability, her website says.

Heumann, who was born in Philadelphia in 1947 and raised in New York City, was the co-author of her memoir, "Being Heumann," and a version for young adults titled, "Rolling Warrior."

Her book recounts the struggle her parents, German-Jewish immigrants who got out before the Holocaust, experienced while trying to secure a place for their daughter in school. "Kids with disabilities were considered a hardship, economically and socially," she wrote.

Rick Heumann said his mother, whom he described as a "bulldog," initially had to homeschool his sister. The experience of fleeing Nazi Germany left the parents and their children with a passion.

"We truly believe," he said, "that discrimination is wrong in any way, shape or form."

Judy Heumann went on to graduate from high school and earn a bachelor's degree from Long Island University and a master's degree in public health from the University of California, Berkeley. It was groundbreaking at the time, which shows just how much has changed, said Maria Town, the president and CEO of the American Association of People with Disabilities.

"Today the expectation for children with disabilities is that we will be included in mainstream education, that we will have a chance to go to high school, to go to college and to get those degrees," Town said while acknowledging that inequities persist. "But I think the fact that the primary assumption has changed is a really big deal, and I also think Judy played a significant role."

She also was featured in the 2020 documentary film, "Crip Camp: A Disability Revolution," which highlighted Camp Jened, a summer camp Heumann attended that helped spark the disability rights movement. The film was nominated for an Academy Award.

During the 1970s she won a lawsuit against the New York Board of Education and became the first teacher in the state who was able to work while using a wheelchair, which the board had tried to claim was a fire hazard.

She also was a leader in a historic, nonviolent occupation of a San Francisco federal building in 1977 that set the stage for passage of the Americans With Disabilities Act, which became law in 1990.

Town, who has cerebral palsy, said Heumann was the one who suggested she use a mobility scooter to make it easier to get around. She wasn't ready to hear it at first after a lifetime of being told she needed to appear less disabled. Eventually, though, she decided to give it a try.

"And it's literally changed my life," Town said. "And that was part of what Judy did. She really helped people accept who they were as disabled people and take pride in that identity. And she helped so many people understand their own power as disabled people."Millions of baby boomers are retiring every day, and the focus is usually on preparing financially for the years ahead.

But experts say it's just as important to get ready emotionally as well.

Andy Ritz left his pediatric practice after 34 years, thinking he was ready. The 64-year-old Ohio resident said retirement has been "fun" so far, and that, while he doesn't regret it, "I'm not gonna say I've enjoyed it."

Ritz has enough money saved up, four rescue dogs for companionship and an impressive collection of film memorabilia, but he often feels as though something is missing.

"When I go to bed at night and I say, 'What did I do today that made it a better day for somebody else in the world?' And the answer if usually nothing," Ritz told CBS News.

Retirement is a seismic life change that can impact mental health. One study found that the prevalence of depression among retirees is about 29%.

Ritz started working with retirement coach Scott Miller.

"People underestimate the amount of change that is about to take place," Miller said of people entering retirement. He said retirement is about "finding meaning, living with a purpose and leaving a legacy."

Miller said the beginning of retirement, usually fueled by travel plans and other to-do lists, is often followed by loneliness. That's why experts say it's important for retirees to replace social connections lost in the workplace and identify and explore new passions, like using their skills to volunteer or mentor others.

Ritz is following that advice, joining the Rotary Club and helping United Way. He's even interested in the training required to have one of his dogs, Rollo, certified as a therapy dog for people in hospice care.

"If I didn't have social connections, I would stay here in my house and not do anything," Ritz said.Yahoo plans to cut about 20% of its workforce, or roughly 1,700 jobs, over the next year, as the technology industry continues to shed employees ahead of a potential economic slump later this year.

Of that number, the internet company will cut 1,000 jobs starting this week, Yahoo confirmed with CBS MoneyWatch.

Nearly half of the layoffs at Yahoo, which has been owned by private equity firm Apollo Global Management since 2021, will be in its unprofitable business ad tech unit. That business has not delivered as the company expected.

"Despite many years of effort and investment, this strategy was not profitable and struggled to live up to our high standards across the entire stack," Yahoo said in a statement.

Yahoo believes the move will "simplify and strengthen our advertising business for the long run, while enabling Yahoo to deliver better value to our customers and partners," it said in the statement.

The job cuts come as some of the country's largest tech companies slash jobs, including Google-parent Alphabet, Amazon, IBM, Lyft, Meta and Microsoft. Tech firms hired at a fast clip during the pandemic but are looking to shed costs as consumers pull back on spending.

In the past month alone, tech companies have cut more than 60,000 jobs, reversing a hiring spree that surged during the pandemic as millions of Americans moved their lives online. Undustry analysts expect further industry cuts in 2023 as the Federal Reserve continues to hike interest rates as it seeks to rein in inflation.Artificial intelligence could create more jobs than it displaces

Salesforce is looking to tap the power of so-called generative artificial intelligence to enhance Slack, its widely used collaborative platform. The software maker announced this week it is integrating ChatGPT into Slack to help employees work more efficiently.

"This will give customers new superpowers by helping them tap the collective knowledge of their organization's channel archives," Salesforce said.

The company's rollout of ChatGPT, which it is currently testing, comes as employers in a range of industries look for ways to use an emerging generation of AI tools able to search vast troves of text, images, audio and other data to produce content and answer queries. In January alone, internet searches for ChatGPT and related terms approached 83 million, according to Similarweb, a web-traffic analytics company.

Here's what ChatGPT will do for Slack users, according to Salesforce.

Summarize conversations

The ChatGPT app can provide short summaries of conversations from Slack channels or threads. Users can use this AI-powered feature to quickly get up to speed on what's happening in their workspace, Salesforce said.

Writing assistance

An AI-powered writing tool can help users draft replies, meeting notes and status updates.

Research

ChatGPT's research tool will allow Slack customers to quickly explore any subject directly from the platform. For example, users can use the tool to research best practices for their businesses or identify potential customers for their sales initiatives, Salesforce said.

Despite ChatGPT's potential, privacy experts have raised concerns about opening corporate networks to AI, which is "trained" by being fed enormous amounts of data. The technology has also drawn criticism for providing faulty information and for its potential to introduce bias in searches.

Salesforce said its platform offers customers "granular controls" to manage third-party access to Slack data, minimizing the security risks. The company also notes that "any data that the app has permission to access" will not be fed to ChatGPT's language model for training the AI.

Still, it remains unclear whether companies that sign up for Slack's ChatGPT beta will be able to set limits on what parts of their proprietary data the AI can use. Last year, for example, experts raised concerns that AI-powered selfie portrait apps like Lensa AI could inappropriately store and manipulate users' photos and hang on to their data.As Sotheby's celebrates 275 years, a look at its past and its future

The oldest known Bible is going up for auction at Sotheby's this year and the auction house expect it will go for $30 million to $50 million. The Codex Sassoon is the the earliest most complete Hebrew Bible, which dates back to the late 9th or early 10th century, and contains all 24 books of the Hebrew Bible, but is missing 12 leaves.

The Bible is named after its most notable owner, David Solomon Sassoon, who died in 1942. Sassoon knew the prayers for the entire liturgical year and practically the entire Hebrew Bible by heart by age 8, according to Sotheby's.

There are older religious manuscripts, like the Dead Sea Scrolls and the Aleppo Codex, which is missing many pages, but the Codex Sassoon is the oldest and most complete. It is nearly a century older than the Leningrad Codex, which is the oldest, fully complete Bible.

The Codex Sassoon is the oldest and most complete Hebrew Bible. It is regarded as the most influential book in human history. Sotheby's

The Codex Sassoon will go up for auction in New York City in May and is expected to become the most valuable historical document ever sold at auction.

The book has not been in public view in 40 years, but this year, it will tour with a Sotheby's exhibit – traveling to London, Tel Aviv, Dallas, Los Angeles and finally, New York City.

The Codex Sassoon has existed over a millennium of human history.

"In Codex Sassoon, a monumental transformation in the history of the Hebrew Bible is revealed," said Sharon Liberman Mintz, a senior Judaica specialist at Sotheby's. "The biblical text in book format marks a critical turning point in how we perceive the history of the Divine word across thousands of years and is a transformative witness to how the Hebrew Bible has influenced the pillars of civilization — art, culture, law, politics — for centuries."The husband of Bishop David O'Connell's housekeeper has been arrested for the bishop's murder, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department announced Monday.

Police arrested 65-year-old Carlos Medina following an overnight standoff at his home in Torrance, L.A. County Sheriff Robert Luna said at a news conference.

O'Connell, the auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, who was 69, was found with a gunshot wound to his upper body in the bedroom of his Hacienda Heights home on Saturday afternoon. He was pronounced dead at the scene.

Luna told reporters that police found the death "suspicious" but they recovered no firearm at the scene and there was no sign of forced entry into the home. Detectives canvassed the neighborhood and found surveillance footage of a dark colored compact SUV pulling into O'Connell's driveway, Luna said.

Then on Sunday morning, detectives received a tip about Medina, who was said to be acting "strange, irrational, and making comments about the bishop owing him money," Luna said.

Medina is the husband of O'Connell's housekeeper and had previously done work around the bishop's residence, and also drove a similar SUV to the one seen in the video, Luna said.

He said the tipster told detectives that Medina had left his Torrance home to go to the Central California area, but at around 2 a.m. Monday morning, a community member told police Medina had returned home. Authorities surrounded Medina's home and called for him to surrender but he refused. Then around 8:15 a.m. Medina exited his residence and was taken into custody without further incident, Luna said.

Authorities recovered two firearms and other possible evidence, which Luna said would be examined to determine if they were connected to the murder.

Luna lamented the murder of the bishop, calling O'Connell a "pillar in our community."

"My heart grieves," he told reporters. "Although I personally did not know the bishop, I cannot tell you how many phone calls I have gotten from people who have worked with him and this man, this bishop, made a huge difference in our community. He was loved. And it is very sad we're gathered here today to talk about his murder."

O'Connell had been a priest for 45 years and was a native of Ireland, according to Angelus News, the archdiocese's news outlet. Pope Francis had named him one of several auxiliary bishops of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles — the largest in the country — in 2015.

O'Connell worked in South Los Angeles for years and focused on gang intervention, Angelus News reported. He later sought to broker peace between residents and law enforcement following the violent 1992 uprising after a jury acquitted four white LA police officers in the beating of Rodney King, a Black man.

Nearly two decades later, O'Connell brought the San Gabriel Valley community together to rebuild a mission there after an arson attack and in recent years spearheaded Catholic efforts in the region to work with immigrant children and families from Central America.California regulators on Friday abruptly shuttered Silicon Valley Bank, closing a 40-year-old financial institution that catered to the tech industry and that was the 16th largest U.S. bank before its sudden collapse. The company's stock tumbled 60% on Thursday and had plunged another 70% on Friday before trading of its shares was halted.

The nosedive reflected fears of a bank run, concerns that materialized as depositors — mostly technology company workers and venture capital-backed companies — rushed to withdraw money this week as anxiety over the bank's balance sheet spread.

Regulators stepped in to take control, with the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation closing the bank and appointing the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) as receiver. It's the largest failure of a financial institution since Washington Mutual in 2008 at the height of the financial crisis more than a decade ago.

On Friday evening, tech firms including streaming company Roku and video game developer Roblox issued regulatory filings disclosing their exposure to Silicon Valley Bank. Roku told investors it had $487 million at the bank, or about 26% of its cash and cash equivalents, adding that those fund are "largely uninsured." Roblox said about 5% of its $3 billion in cash and securities were held at Silicon Valley Bank.

Typically, bank stocks are staid affairs, which makes Silicon Valley Bank's failure and its regulator-ordered closure all the more noteworthy. Here's what to know about the bank's startling downfall.

What is Silicon Valley Bank?

Silicon Valley Bank, founded in 1983, grew rapidly with the explosion of businesses in the tech-focused region, eventually expanding to more than a dozen states and countries including Israel, Ireland and Germany. Before its failure, it ranked as the 16th largest bank in the country, holding $210 billion in assets.

Silicon Valley Bank offers business lending products such as loans to help finance acquisitions or projects, touting on its website that it "helps businesses at every stage." The bank also provides private banking services and other financial products.

Why was it closed by regulators?

The California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation on Friday said it has taken possession of Silicon Valley Bank. The reason, it said, was "inadequate liquidity and insolvency."

What happens to depositors and clients?

The FDIC said it created a new institution, the Deposit Insurance National Bank of Santa Clara (DINB), and that it had immediately transferred all insured deposits at Silicon Valley Bank to the new bank. All insured depositors will have access to their insured deposits by Monday morning, March 13, the FDIC said in a statement.

Meanwhile, uninsured depositors will receive "an advance dividend within the next week," as well as a receivership certificate for the remaining amount of their uninsured funds.

The main office and its 17 branches will reopen for business on March 13, the FDIC said.

"Banking activities will resume no later than Monday, March 13, including on-line banking and other services," the agency said. "Silicon Valley Bank's official checks will continue to clear."

The standard insurance from FDIC covers $250,000 for each depositor per insured bank. That limit is also per ownership category, such as single accounts or retirement accounts, so one person may have assets with insurance coverage that exceeds $250,000, the FDIC says.

What are bank customers saying?

One Silicon Valley Bank client, FarmboxRx CEO Ashley Tyrner CEO, told CBS MoneyWatch that the events of the last 24 hours have "been nothing short of shocking."

Tyrner, whose company works with health care plans to deliver food to underserved communities, said she was surprised to learn about the financial challenges facing Silicon Valley Bank.

"By the time we began seeing articles it was already a full-swing bank run," Tyrner said in an email. "It seems that while the venture capital circle was publicly boasting their support for SVB in attempt to stabilize the panic, they were calling their portfolio companies behind closed doors telling them to move funds immediately."

She said her company wasn't able to log into its accounts and that the bank's help line had a "disconnected" message or hung up. "[N]one of our account reps would respond to calls or emails," she added.

Tyrner said she plans on moving the remaining funds in the account once she regains access to it.

Why did the bank collapse?

On March 8, Silicon Valley Bank parent SVB Financial Group said that it was taking "strategic actions," including selling almost all of its available-for-sale securities — $21 billion in bonds. It also said it planned to issue stock as part of the plan to raise capital and strengthen its finances.

SVB, which noted that it would take a $1.8 billion loss on the bond sales, said it needed to take the steps because of higher interest rates and "elevated cash burn levels" by customers. The company also pointed to "pressured public and private markets."

The bank's heavy exposure to the tech sector played a part in its downfall, noted Chenxi Wang, founder and general partner of Rain Capital, in an email. Some of its tech company clients were burning through cash faster than expected in early 2023, Silicon Valley Bank said in its March 8 investor letter. That resulted in lower deposits than forecast, according to the bank.

Silicon Valley Bank's problems were exacerbated by rapidly rising interest rates over the last year, which reduced the value of its bond holdings.

"The bank also made balance sheet management errors by putting too much money into long-term bonds, which became a problem when interest rates surged," Wang said. That "caused non-trivial panic."

The March 8 announcement spooked investors, sparking concerns that clients would yank funds due to the bank's financial uncertainty, which in turn would limit the bank's ability to tap other liquidity sources, said Brandon King, an analyst at Truist, in a note to investors.

"The stock reaction today is evident of concerns around the bank's liquidity," King said.

What are tech investors saying?

Prior to California's decision to shutter the bank, the reaction within Silicon Valley ranged the gamut, with Founders Fund, a venture capital firm co-founded by Peter Thiel, advising companies to take their money out of the bank, Bloomberg News reported.

But others had urged companies and clients to stay put, such as Two Sigma Ventures investor Villi Iltchev, an investor, who wrote on Twitter that Silicon Valley Bank deserved support. "SVB is the most important capital provider to tech startups and the biggest supporter of the community. Now is the time to support them," tweeted Villi.

The question was whether clients would opt to remain with the bank or trigger a classic bank run. Fears about an institution's possible insolvency can become self-fulfilling if enough customers pull their money out of the bank.

"Banks are not like normal companies, and one in crisis can't wait to run a normal auction process — they depend on the confidence of depositors and even an inkling of doubt can snowball faster than nearly anyone imagines, impairing the value of the franchise," wrote Wall Street analyst Adam Crisafulli of Vital Knowledge in a report.

How is this impacting Wall Street and other banks?

Other bank stocks fell Thursday as Silicon Valley Bank shares swooned. Banks lost a total of about $100 billion in market value over the last two days, according to Reuters.

Still, analysts said that Silicon Valley Bank's woes are unlikely to ripple through the banking industry as a whole.

"Current pressures facing SIVB are highly idiosyncratic and should not be viewed as a read-across to other banks," Morgan Stanley analysts Manan Gosalia and Betsy Graseck wrote in a note Friday, according to CNBC.

Silicon Valley Bank could yet impact a major part of the U.S. economy in that tech companies could lose a valuable source of financing, noted Bill Ackman, CEO of hedge fund Pershing Square, on Twitter.

"The failure of [Silicon Valley Bank] could destroy an important long-term driver of the economy as VC-backed companies rely on SVB for loans and holding their operating cash," he noted.

On Friday, large, diversified banks such as Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase pulled out of an early slump due to data released Friday by the Labor Department.

Regional banks, particularly those with heavy exposure to the tech industry, were in decline. Yet it has been a bruising week, with shares of major banks are down this week between 7% and 12%.

With reporting by the Associated Press.A group of scientists analyzing global data collected over the past four decades have found a "rapid increase" in ocean plastic pollution since 2005, according to a research article published in the journal Plos One. That increase has created a "plastic smog" in the world's oceans made up of an estimated 171 trillion plastic particles, the scientists said.

The authors used 11,777 samples taken from the surface layer of oceans, which is roughly the first 600 feet of depth, to estimate the average amount of microplastics in that layer over time, then compared that to an historic overview of international policy measures aimed at reducing ocean pollution.

"Our data shows an increase in ocean plastic pollution at the same time as a decrease in effective laws and agreements. There are many factors to consider (e.g., increases in production and waste, fragmentation of existing plastics), but the need for legally binding agreements cannot be overstated," said The 5 Gyres Institute, which organized the study.

The researchers said they identified similar trends for plastic pollution on beaches, and that "these parallel trends strongly suggest that plastic pollution in the world's oceans during the past 15 years has reached unprecedented levels."

Without urgent policy intervention to limit plastic production, they said, the rate at which plastic waste will enter the ocean between now and 2040 will increase by around 2.6 times.

"The exponential increase in microplastics across the world's oceans is a stark warning that we must act now at a global scale, stop focusing on cleanup and recycling, and usher in an age of corporate responsibility for the entire life of the things they make," said Dr. Marcus Eriksen, one of the authors of the study.

Eriksen said the increase in plastic waste over the past decade and a half corresponded with a decrease in the effectiveness of maritime policies.

"Cleanup is futile if we continue to produce plastic at the current rate, and we have heard about recycling for too long while the plastic industry simultaneously rejects any commitments to buy recycled material or design for recyclability. It's time to address the plastic problem at the source."Dubai, United Arab Emirates — Iran and Saudi Arabia on Friday agreed to reestablish diplomatic relations and reopen embassies after years of tensions between the two countries, including a devastating attack on the heart of the kingdom's oil production attributed to Tehran. The deal, struck in Beijing this week amid its ceremonial National People's Congress, represents a major diplomatic victory for the Chinese as Gulf Arab states perceive the United States slowly withdrawing from the wider Middle East. It also comes as diplomats have been trying to end a yearslong war in Yemen, a conflict in which both Iran and Saudi Arabia are deeply entrenched.

The two countries released a joint communique on the deal with China, which brokered the agreement. Chinese state media did not immediately report the agreement.

Iranian state media posted images and video they said were taken in China of the meeting. It showed Ali Shamkhani, the secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, with Saudi national security adviser Musaad bin Mohammed al-Aiban and Wang Yi, China's most senior diplomat.

"After implementing of the decision, the foreign ministers of both nations will meet to prepare for exchange of ambassadors," Iranian state television said. It added that the talks had been held over four days.

The joint statement calls for the reestablishing of ties and the reopening of embassies to happen "within a maximum period of two months."

In the video aired by Iranian media, Wang could be heard offering "whole-hearted congratulations" on the two countries' "wisdom."

"Both sides have displayed sincerity," he said. "China fully supports this agreement."

China, which recently hosted Iran's hard-line President Ebrahim Raisi, is also a top purchaser of Saudi oil. President Xi Jinping, just awarded a third five-year term as president earlier on Friday, visited Riyadh in December to attend meetings with oil-rich Gulf Arab nations crucial to China's energy supplies.

Iran's state-run IRNA news agency quoted Shamkhani as calling the talks "clear, transparent, comprehensive and constructive."

"Removing misunderstandings and the future-oriented views in relations between Tehran and Riyadh will definitely lead to improving regional stability and security, as well as increasing cooperation among Persian Gulf nations and the world of Islam for managing current challenges," Shamkhani was quoted as saying.

Shortly after the Iranian announcement, Saudi state media began publishing the same statement.

Faisal J. Abbas, the editor-in-chief of the Saudi-based newspaper, Arab News, told CBS News' Amjad Tadros on Friday that the agreement "could be the beginning of a game-changing era, whereby for the first time in decades we can hope to live without conflict."

Abbas cautioned, however, that it was still the "early days of this agreement, and there needs to be a trust-building period and actions on the ground to help build it."

"As a Saudi, I really hope this is an opportunity for Iran to focus on building its economy and looking after its people," said Abbas. "If we can reach a situation with both countries thriving, no further conflicts and we achieve peace and prosperity then this is good not just for Saudi Arabia, but for the whole region."

Asked whether he thought the U.S. had deliberately been side-lined in the negotiations, Abbas said he didn't see it as "intentional or representative of a lack of trust" between Saudi Arabia and the U.S., which he said remained "a steadfast and the most important of Saudi strategic allies."

He noted, however, likely referring to Iran's position, that for negotiations of this type "to succeed, they need to be shrouded in secrecy and done through mediators which both parties accept as fair and without bias or a conflict of interest."

Tensions have been high between Iran and Saudi Arabia. The kingdom broke off ties with Iran in 2016 after protesters invaded Saudi diplomatic posts there. Saudi Arabia had executed a prominent Shiite cleric days earlier, triggering the demonstrations.

The execution came as Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, then a deputy, began his rise to power. The son of King Salman, Prince Mohammed at one point compared Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to Nazi Germany's Adolf Hitler, and also threatened to strike Iran.

In the years since, tensions have risen dramatically across the Middle East since the U.S. unilaterally withdrew from Iran's nuclear deal with world powers in 2018. Iran has been blamed for a series of attacks in the time since, including one that targeted the heart of Saudi Arabia's oil industry in 2019, temporarily halving the kingdom's crude production.

Though Yemen's Iranian-backed Houthi rebels initially claimed the attack, Western nations and experts have blamed the attack on Tehran. Iran long has denied launching the attack. It has also denied carrying out other assaults later attributed to the Islamic Republic.

Kristian Ulrichsen, a research fellow at Rice University's Baker Institute who long has studied the region, said Saudi Arabia reaching the deal with Iran came after the United Arab Emirates reached a similar understanding with Tehran.

"This dialing down of tensions and de-escalation has been underway for three years and this was triggered by Saudi acknowledgement in their view that without unconditional U.S. backing they were unable to project power vis-a-vi Iran and the rest of the region," he said.

Prince Mohammed, now focused on massive construction projects in his own country, likely wants to finally pull out of the Yemen war as well, Ulrichsen added.

"Instability could do a lot of damage to his plans," he said.

The Houthis seized Yemen's capital, Sanaa, in September 2014 and forced the internationally recognized government into exile in Saudi Arabia. A Saudi-led coalition armed with U.S. weaponry and intelligence entered the war on the side of Yemen's exiled government in March 2015. Years of inconclusive fighting has created a humanitarian disaster and pushed the Arab world's poorest nation to the brink of famine.

A six-month cease-fire in Yemen's war, the longest of the conflict, expired in October despite diplomatic efforts to renew it. That led to fears the war could again escalate. More than 150,000 people have been killed in Yemen during the fighting, including over 14,500 civilians.

In recent months, negotiations have been ongoing, including in Oman, a longtime interlocutor between Iran and the U.S. Some have hoped for an agreement ahead of the holy Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, which will begin later in March. Iran and Saudi Arabia have held off-and-on talks in recent years, but it wasn't immediately clear if Yemen was the impetus for this new detente.

The U.S. Navy and its allies have seized a number of weapons shipments recently they describe as coming from Iran heading to Yemen. Iran denies arming the Houthis, despite weapons seized mirroring others seen on the battlefield in the rebels' hands. A United Nations arms embargo bars nations from sending weapons to the Houthis.

It remains unclear, however, what this means for America. Though long viewed as guaranteeing Mideast energy security, regional leaders have grown increasingly wary of Washington's intentions after its chaotic 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan. The U.S. State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment over the announced deal.Diet and brain health: You are what you eat?

People who follow a Mediterranean or MIND diet may have fewer signs of Alzheimer's disease in their brain tissue, according to a new study.

Published Wednesday in the online issue of Neurology, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology, the study found those who follow these plant-focused diets may have fewer amyloid plaques and tau tangles in their brain than people who don't eat this way.

A Mediterranean diet, patterned on the traditional cuisines of the region, emphasizes fresh fruits and vegetables, fish, legumes, nuts and whole grains.

The MIND diet stands for "Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay" and combines many elements of the Mediterranean and DASH ("Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension") diets.

"These results are exciting," said study author Puja Agarwal, PhD, of Rush University in Chicago, in a press release. "While our research doesn't prove that a healthy diet resulted in fewer brain deposits of amyloid plaques, also known as an indicator of Alzheimer's disease, we know there is a relationship and following the MIND and Mediterranean diets may be one way that people can improve their brain health and protect cognition as they age."

After accounting for other factors in the 581 people they studied, researchers found "people who scored highest for adhering to the Mediterranean diet had average plaque and tangle amounts in their brains similar to being 18 years younger than people who scored lowest." And for those who scored highest in following the MIND diet, their plaque and tangle amounts were similar to being 12 years younger.

While looking at specific diet components, researchers found leafy greens appeared to be the biggest asset.

"People who ate the highest amounts of green leafy vegetables, or seven or more servings per week, had plaque amounts in their brains corresponding to being almost 19 years younger than people who ate the fewest, with one or fewer servings per week," the release stated.

"Our finding that eating more green leafy vegetables is in itself associated with fewer signs of Alzheimer's disease in the brain is intriguing enough for people to consider adding more of these vegetables to their diet," said Agarwal.

Amyloid plaques and tau tangles in the brain are associated with the development of Alzheimer's disease, although their specific cause is not clear, and the researchers note they may also appear in some older people whose cognitive functioning was not impaired.

The Mediterranean diet focuses on "vegetables, fruit and three or more servings of fish per week," while the MIND diet prioritizes "green leafy vegetables like spinach, kale and collard greens along with other vegetables... prioritizes berries over other fruit and recommends one or more servings of fish per week," the release explains.

The study did have limitations. Participants were mostly White, non-Hispanic and older, so the results "cannot be generalized to other populations," the release states.

"Future studies are needed to establish our findings further," Agarwal added.

And while this latest study does not prove causation, it follows previous research finding a similar association between our diet and brain health.

In 2015, researchers found the MIND diet may reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease by as much as 53%.

Even those who didn't stick to the diet perfectly but followed it "moderately well" reduced their risk of Alzheimer's by about a third, according to the study.Google-parent Alphabet is rolling out an artificial intelligence-powered chatbot dubbed "Bard" as it competes with the fast-emerging ChatGPT, backed by rival Microsoft.

In a blog post on Monday, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said the company is sharing Bard with "trusted testers ahead of making it more widely available to the public in the coming weeks."

The tool "seeks to combine the breadth of the world's knowledge with the power, intelligence and creativity of our large language models," Pichai said in his post, calling AI "the most profound technology we are working on today."

Bard uses Google's Language Model for Dialogue Applications, or LaMDA — the same AI model that one former Google engineer claimed was sentient. LaMDA is trained on vast amounts of dialogue to create something resembling a free-flowing conversation. For testing, Bard will use a scaled-down version of LamDA that requires less computing power, Pichai said, which will allow more users to try it out.

Unlike ChatGPT, which is trained on data ending in 2021, Bard pulls information from the web and can "provide fresh, high-quality responses," according to Pichai. For example, someone can ask Bard to explain NASA's James Webb Space Telescope to a 9-year-old, or ask whether the piano or guitar are easier to learn, according to the post.

Google's AI tools help a person decide what instrument they want to learn in this Alphabet-provided example. Alphabet

Google plans to add AI-powered features to its search tool in order to "distill complex information and multiple perspectives into easy-to-digest formats," according to the post.

The explosive growth of ChatGPT, in which Microsoft has invested billions, has created panic at Google, the New York Times reported. Its main product, search, has come in for a reassessment from some users, with some now turning to ChatGPT to answer questions they previously asked Google.

AI language models have also faced criticism, with academics and activists noting that AI reproduces the biases and errors of the information on which it's trained.Michael Cohen, Donald Trump's former attorney and fixer, is expected to testify to a Manhattan grand jury next week amid an investigation into the former president, a person familiar with the plans told CBS News.

The New York Times first reported the timing of the testimony.

Cohen has been preparing for an appearance before a grand jury examining allegations related to alleged "hush money" payments to adult film actress Stormy Daniels during former President Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.

A week ago, Cohen said he had met with prosecutors 18 times. He met again with investigators on Friday, telling reporters he had not testified before the grand jury yet.

The Manhattan District Attorney's Office has also invited Trump to testify before the grand jury, a move that suggests he could face an indictment in the case, according to a source familiar with the matter. An offer to testify often precedes an indictment in New York.

"The Manhattan District Attorney's threat to indict President Trump is simply insane," a Trump spokesperson said in a statement Thursday. "For the past five years, the DA's office has been on a Witch Hunt, investigating every aspect of President Trump's life, and they've come up empty at every turn — and now this."

Kellyanne Conway, Trump's White House counselor and former campaign manager, met for at least the second time with prosecutors on Wednesday. Days earlier, Trump's former director of strategic communications, Hope Hicks, was also reportedly escorted into the D.A.'s office building through the back entrance.

Robert Costa contributed to this report.The military service academies saw the highest level of estimated instances of sexual assault or harassment since at least 2006, according to an annual Defense Department report, while one in five female students reported experiencing unwanted sexual contact, an anonymous survey found.

"Our numbers indicate that this is the highest sexual assault estimated prevalence rate for both women and men at the military service academies since the department started measuring this in 2006. These numbers are extremely disappointing and upsetting," Defense Force Resiliency executive director Beth Foster said Friday.

The Pentagon conducts an anonymous prevalence survey every two years to estimate the number of unwanted sexual contact instances. The 2021-22 survey is the first conducted since 2018, since coronavirus precautions resulted in the cancellation of the survey in 2020.

About 1,136 students attending the Army, Navy and Air Force service academies, around 21% of women and 4% of men surveyed, said they had experienced unwanted sexual contact in the 2021-2022 school year, the office's deputy director, Dr. Nathan Galbreath, said. However, only 155 cadets and midshipmen reported a sexual assault had taken place during their service, a rise of 34 cases, or 18%, from the previous year.

The prevalence survey, which tracks only the instances and circumstances of unwanted sexual contact and not official reports, recorded numbers that are far higher than the number of reported incidents. In total, the Defense Department received 206 reports during the year, which includes prep school students and cadets or midshipmen who reported incidents that had taken place before they entered service.

The largest increase in reports was seen at the U.S. Naval Academy, in Annapolis, Maryland, where 61 reports of sexual assaults were made, double the amount of cases reported of the prior year. In the 2020-2021 academic year, the Naval Academy reported 33 cases, the lowest of all three schools that year.

At the U.S. Military Academy in West Point, New York, the cases appeared to slightly decrease from the previous year, dropping from 46 reports last year to 42 in the 2021-2022 school year. At the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, the number of cases reported stayed the same from the previous year, with 52.

Reporting cases of sexual assault is often just the begining. Unrestricted reports — those that are not submitted confidentially — can trigger an investigation and may result in disciplinary action. According to the report, 77 investigations associated with 80 sexual assault reports were opened this year. Between the number of previously pending cases, and those from this academic year, investigations into 151 accused attackers were completed — but in only 61 of those cases had decisions been made about whether to charge, discipline, or pursue other action against offenders.

Among the 43 individuals for whom charges were considered, none of the accusations were determined to be unfounded by legal or command review, and sexual assault charges were substantiated for 23 of those accused. Only nine faced a court martial, three received administrative discharges, and 11 were dealt "other adverse administrative actions."

In addition to this year's report, the prevalence survey is used by the department to better understand the circumstances around assaults and why they remain so underreported.

The survey found that women and men were more likely to experience unwanted sexual contact in their second year in the academy. Students also reported that alcohol also plays a large role. Over half of the instances of unwanted sexual contact in some way involved alcohol for 61% of women and 58% of men who participated in the survey.

"This problem may be getting worse"

"Our cadets and midshipmen, our future military leaders, should be able to learn and grow in an environment free of sexual assault and harassment," Foster said. "And while these numbers are troubling, it is important to acknowledge that we've had a number of prior indicators that tell us that this problem may be getting worse."

In response to the "alarming increase" indicated in the department's findings, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin sent a memorandum to secretaries of the military detailing action items to address the rise in sexual assault. Those directives include issuing a policy that requires the physical separation of survivors and alleged perpetrators. According to the memo, "to the extent practicable, cadet and midshipman survivors and alleged perpetrators of sexual assault to complete their coursework without taking classes together or being in close, physical proximity during mandatory activities."

However in a briefing, DOD officials acknowledged that class separation is workable, but preventing interaction outside of the classroom at the service academies where students largely live in the same dormitory and eat at the same dining hall, is not as "practicable."

Additionally, the academies will work with their respective branch's Judge Advocates General office to educate cadets on the changes expected to be made to military justice policies including the creation of the Office of Special Trial Counsel which will have the authority — instead of the academies' superintendents — to decide how to move forward with cases of sexual assault. The new military justice reforms go into effect in December.

The numbers have continued to rise despite efforts by lawmakersl and advocacy groups to reduce the rate of sexual assault at the three academies. In 2017, CBS News's Norah O'Donnell reported that cadets at the Air Force Academy faced retaliation for reporting, and that often the school attempted to cover up the circumstances surrounding reports.

In response to the CBS News investigation, then-superintendent Lt. Gen. Jay Silveria said he was "disgusted" by the reports, but stopped short of saying the academy had problems handling sexual assault. "I don't think there are problems, and let me tell you why. It is that you talked about some of the reporting of the numbers of sexual assaults. I want numbers of reports to go up. I know that doesn't make sense right on the surface, but I want reporting to go up … so that I can provide that care, provide that support," Silveria said.A bill introduced in the Texas Senate is triggering alarm among LGBTQ+ advocates in the state, who say it would make nearly all gender-affirming health care illegal, including both surgical and nonsurgical treatments — even for trans adults.

"While we've seen several bills that would criminalize life-saving health care for trans people, none go as far as this," Rachel Hill, the government affairs director at the advocacy organization Equality Texas, told CBS News.

"This bill bans any public funding for trans health care at any age and puts impossible constraints on medical professionals and insurance providers," Hill added.

The bill, S.B. 1029, which was introduced on Feb. 17 by Republican state Sen. Bob Hall, would ban "public funding for gender modifications and treatments," bar some health plans from providing "coverage for a gender modification procedure," and increase legal liability through malpractice suits for medical professionals or health care providers that offer gender-affirming care.

The bill lists as gender-affirming procedures any surgeries performed on a patient's genitals, mastectomies, and prescriptions of puberty blockers or hormones "for the purpose of transitioning a patient's biological sex ... or affirming the patient's perception of the patient's sex."

CBS News made multiple attempts to contact Hall's office, but has yet to hear back.

"This bill would have a chilling effect, halting all best practice medical care for all trans people in this state, regardless of age," Christopher Hamilton, CEO of Texas Health Action, a nonprofit that works to provide health services to the LGBTQIA+ community, told CBS News. "If this bill passes, insurers will no longer cover gender-affirming care, malpractice insurers will not provide malpractice insurance to providers, and physicians will not assume a personal financial lifetime liability for providing gender affirming care, affecting nearly 100,000 trans people in the state."

Texas has introduced over 70 anti-LGBTQ+ bills in the 2023 legislative season so far, according to Equality Texas. While legal challenges have prevented most bills from becoming law, critics say the legislative efforts marginalize and stigmatize transgender people.

I’ve been intentionally trying to keep my consumption of anti-trans legislation to a minimum but I just read TX SB 1029 and I’m starting to feel like that was a bad idea given the fact that I can’t stop shaking and my heart won’t stop racing 🙃 — Dev (they/them) (@legally_dev) February 19, 2023

S.B. 1029 would likely face legal challenges — and some advocates acknowledge that it might not pass — but its introduction is seen as indicative of a larger agenda to politicize trans issues and access to health care.

"If someone who is trans needs a mastectomy for cancer, they may have to prove that it is for cancer care rather than what the bill calls 'gender modification,'" said Hamilton. "If a trans person with a uterus needs a hysterectomy for cancer prevention, will this person be denied because of the doctor's fear?"

The American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics have spoken out against what the AMA calls "governmental intrusion into the practice of medicine that is detrimental to the health of transgender and gender-diverse children and adults."

In 2022, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott made headlines after sending a letter to the state's health agencies, ordering them to report and investigate gender-affirming treatment to trans youth as potential "child abuse." A Texas judge blocked the directive after several families sued.

In the letter, Abbott categorized "reassignment surgeries that can cause sterilization, mastectomies, removals of otherwise healthy body parts, and administration of puberty-blocking drugs or supraphysiologic doses of testosterone or estrogen" as "abusive" — all of which would be banned under the new bill.

"This bill is extremely alarming as it resembles what Texas did with reproductive rights, removing any way for people to get safe, best-practice medical care without having an outright ban," Hamilton said.

Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick recently announced his legislative priorities for 2023, including bills to restrict transgender student athlete participation in collegiate sports, and end gender-transition treatment for young people. Patrick said he believed Texans support his proposals because they "largely reflect the policies supported by the conservative majority of Texans."

According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, "early gender affirming care is crucial to overall health and well-being" for trans and nonbinary youth, "as it allows the child or adolescent to focus on social transitions and can increase their confidence while navigating the healthcare system."

Experts say that access to gender-affirming care can be a life-or-death issue for trans people. A study published in the journal Pediatrics found that nearly 51% of female-to-male respondents had attempted suicide — far higher than the average youth suicide rate, according to a 2022 study by UCLA.

Access to medical care, participation in sports, and other issues affecting trans youth and adults have become the focus of intense political debate in the U.S. in recent years, with predominantly Republican lawmakers in more than two dozen states attempting to enact measures that would either heavily restrict or completely ban access to gender-affirming care and other resources.

"By filing these bills, lawmakers are playing politics with the very lives of transgender people in our state," Ash Hall, a policy and advocacy strategist at the ACLU of Texas, told CBS News.

"The mental health toll and harm that even debating this bill would cause is catastrophic," Hall added.

It's been nine years since Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370, a Boeing 777 with 239 people on board, vanished. Now the story of its disappearance, along with the fruitless search for survivors, is being explored by Netflix.

An Australian led-hunt for the plane ended in 2017 and a private firm's search ended the following year. The investigation searched nearly 50,000-square miles of sea floor. Searchers spent around $160 million in the hunt for the plane — and found only some debris from the flight. The plane itself has never been located.

The streaming giant launched "MH370: The Plane that Disappeared" on Wednesday. The day marked nine years since the plane went missing on March 8, 2014, during a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.

The first 90-minute episode of the docuseries deals with the first few days after the Boeing 777 vanished. The second episode dives into conspiracy theories about the plane's disappearance, and the final episode deals with the ongoing search for answers by some journalists and family members.

The series features scientists, reporters and family members of victims who were on the plane. In all, 153 of the 240 people on board were Chinese nationals. Series director Louise Malkinson said the families want the people to keep talking about the flight's disappearance.

"The families want a platform to be able to say, 'Come on, it's been nine years,'" Malkinson said in a Netflix release about the series. "They were all united on that."Watch scenes from the performances nominated in the category of best actress at the 95th annual Academy Awards, as well as interviews with the stars at the links below.

The Oscars will be presented on March 12.

Cate Blanchett, "Tár"

Cate Blanchett won the best actress BAFTA and Golden Globe for her riveting and at times grueling performance as Lydia Tár, a celebrated Berlin orchestra conductor whose professional success (cresting with her rehearsals for a cycle of Mahler recordings) and marriage is jeopardized by her actions, which open up a wave of attacks on social media, fueling charges of cancel culture. Written and directed by Todd Field ("Little Children"), the film is provocative and at times brutally caustic in its examination of a woman seeking to remake herself, whose personal demons drive her to self-destruct.

Part of what is fascinating about Blanchett's performance is the performative nature of it. In her early scenes as Lydia Tár, on stage or in her Juilliard master class, there is a rigid, almost script-reading cadence to her dialogue; yet in private, more intimate scenes, her delivery is more naturalistic, less self-assured (or more threatening). We come to realize that in public Lydia is herself playing a character, the character of Lydia Tár, who comes undone when she is no longer in control.

In this scene, when we are introduced to her during an interview with The New Yorker's Adam Gopnik, Lydia describes her function as an orchestra conductor:

Blanchett learned to play the piano and studied conducting, including stick technique, for the role. She told "Sunday Morning" that when she led the orchestra (in German, no less), "I had to do a lot of preparation. But I mean, look, an audience couldn't be less interested in an actor's homework, because it's like, Look how hard I worked. You know, it's like, who cares?"

But she loves the homework. "I do. I mean, I found the whole thing fascinating."

She described how her character combined the powerful and the vulnerable: "Yeah, we've all got those dualities in us, don't we? And I think I we spend half of our lives in the middle of a confidence trick of pretending we've got our s*** together when, in fact, you know, we don't. The world and being alive is full of nuance and gray areas. And I think that that's where the film is really human and really provocative."

It's an exquisite performance that earned Blanchett her eighth Academy Award nomination. She has previously won two Oscars (for "The Aviator" and "Blue Jasmine").

"Tár" is now in theaters, and available on demand and home video, and streaming on Peacock.

Ana de Armas, "Blonde"

Playing a tortured soul is a recurring theme among Oscar-nominated performances. Playing an acting or music legend is another. Ana de Armas, who became a star in "Knives Out" and held her own on screen opposite Daniel Craig in "No Time to Die," earned praise for playing movie icon Marilyn Monroe in the Netflix biopic.

This clip shifts in time from Monroe watching herself in her breakthrough role in "All About Eve," to her memory of herself, as Norma Jeane, attending an acting class:

The film, adapted from the Joyce Carol Oates novel about Monroe, received more than its share of critical drubbing for being exploitative (as well as garnering an NC-17 rating); in fact, "Blonde" leads this year's Razzies, awarded to the worst film of the year. But de Armas was hailed for her performance.

She told the Hollywood Reporter, "I'm horrible at imitating people. If you told me to impersonate someone, I cannot. Not even my friends. People always said, 'Can you do Marilyn's voice?' For me, it was not like that. It's not a switch that I could just turn on and off. It needed some preparation and thinking before it could come out. There were not little things or tricks that I could do to make it work. There were no shortcuts. I had to be mentally there, in that emotional state, for the whole thing to come together. It was like a study of her whole [inner] state, what she was thinking [and] feeling at all times."

This is de Armas' first Academy Award nomination.

"Blonde" is available to stream on Netflix.

Andrea Riseborough, "To Leslie"

One of the biggest surprises of the morning when Oscar nominations were announced was to hear Andrea Riseborough's name, in connection with a little-seen, barely-discussed entry in this award season discussion.

In "To Leslie," Riseborough plays a single mother in Texas who squanders a lottery prize, and tries to redeem her life and her relationship with her son, despite the ever-present specter of alcohol dogging her.

In this scene Leslie is confronted by her grown son James (Owen Teague) about her addiction:

Riseborough has given sterling performances in a number of high-profile films, including the Oscar-winning "Birdman," "W.E.," "Resistance," "Shadow Dancer," "Battle of the Sexes," "The Death of Stalin," and "Matilda the Musical." As Leslie, her haunting character is filled with the sadness and anger of an alcoholic refusing to admit to her dependency, throwing away any sense of agency over her life.

She told The Hollywood Reporter that she recognized the very personal nature of Ryan Binaco's script, which was based on a true story: "Sometimes you read something and you think, 'Oh, this is that one important story for them.' That was clear on the page. It was a celebration of somebody – in all of the glorious and horrible moments."

"To Leslie" bowed at last year's South by Southwest festival, and received a modest theatrical release (it earned $27,000 at the box office). But without a major promotional campaign backing its awards chances, the film's director and his wife launched a grassroots effort, built on praise for Riseborough's performance from other actors, including Cate Blanchett, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Charlize Theron.

The Academy investigated whether the social media campaign violated its rules, throwing Riseborough's nomination into jeopardy. But the nod remained.

"To Leslie" is available on demand and home video.

Michelle Williams, "The Fabelmans"

Michelle Williams has previously been nominated for Academy Awards for "Brokeback Mountain," "Blue Valentine," "My Week with Marilyn" (playing Marilyn Monroe!), and "Manchester by the Sea." In Steven Spielberg's "The Fabelmans," she plays Mitzi, mother of Sammy Fabelman, a young aspiring filmmaker.

In this film à clef, Mitzi is a stand-in for Spielberg's mother, Leah, and like Leah she divorces her husband after having an affair with her husband's best friend.

The film is told through Sammy's eyes, and so we see his vision of his mother change, from that of the nurturing woman who encourages him to use a movie camera to calm his fears — a secret the two share — to a parent whose seemingly selfish actions upend his entire world — a secret he happens to uncover through his camera.

In this scene, Mitzi offers Sammy an 8mm instrument of self-actualization:

Years later, Mitzi apologizes to her son for hitting him, though the apology is really for something else:

In an appearance on "The Late Show With Stephen Colbert," Williams said of acting in "The Fabelmans," "I still feel like I'm having an out-of-body experience with it, just like — I'm in a movie with Steven Spielberg?"

She spoke of the voluminous home movie footage that Spielberg had of his mother: "She was kind of a larger-than-life person. She really just comes through in everything you see, everything you listen to. She had this incredible laugh that was kind of like my touchstone for the part I would listen to before every take, this guide track of her laughing over the years."

"The Fabelmans" is now in theaters, and available on demand and home video.

Michelle Yeoh, "Everything Everywhere All at Once"

After decades of stardom in Hong Kong action films and international blockbusters (including "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" and "Crazy Rich Asians"), Michelle Yeoh earned her first Academy Award nomination for "Everything Everywhere All at Once." She plays Evelyn Wang, a woman who is being investigated by the IRS and being called upon to help save the universe. Not the typical plight of an immigrant laundromat owner, but then, The Daniels' tongue-in-cheek tale of the multiverse is not your typical action-comedy.

For one thing, the part of Evelyn was originally written for a man, and pitched to her "Supercop" costar Jackie Chan. She told "Sunday Morning," "He texted me and he said, 'Hey, congratulations on your film. Do you know your directors came to look for me first?' I said, 'Yes, bro, I know! Your loss, bro, thank you!'"

The actress, now 60, said she did not expect such a rich character — and such a physical role — would come to her. "Oh, I had a spectacular career," she said. "But, you know, you don't want it to just slow down or end because you have gotten to a certain age and, you know, you start getting scripts where the guy, your hero, is still in his fifties, sixties — some even more! — and then they get to go on the adventure with your daughter! And then you go like, 'No, come on, guys, give me a chance, because I feel that I am still able to do all that.'"

In this scene Evelyn connects to her multiverse versions of herself, including a kung fu master, in order to fend off an attack – and in the process sees alternate paths for herself and her husband, Waymond (Oscar-nominee Ke Huy Quan):

In this scene, Michelle Yeoh gets to demonstrate some of her action film prowess, as Evelyn and an IT guy — each connected by earpieces to multiverse versions of themselves — engage in some impressive martial arts skills, until their connections are lost. Skill sets gone!

"Everything Everywhere All at Once" is now in theaters, and available on demand and home video, and streaming on Showtime

The 41-year-old mom may be older than her compatriots at the Sigma Kappa sorority house at Bowling Green State University in Ohio, but she still feels right at home.

Eckert's husband, Andy Eckert, died fighting in the Iraq War. Her son Myles went viral in 2014 when he gave a $20 bill he found in a Cracker Barrel parking lot to an airman he saw in the restaurant. His tribute touched the nation, but it isn't the only emotional story in the family.

It's because of her husband that Eckert is in this sorority house, she says.

"Just a few hours before my husband was killed, he called home from Iraq and he said no matter how long it took, I had to get an education," Eckert said. "He made me promise I would. And then he told me 'I love you more than anything else in this world - I'll call you tomorrow.'"

That call never came, and Eckert's promise became the last one she ever made him. Until recently, it was the only one she hadn't kept.

Eckert said that she barely made it through high school, and she was occupied raising the couple's three children. But those kids grew up, and three years ago, she decided to enroll and immerse herself in the college experience.

"You can't focus on the negative, because you'll always be in the pit," Eckert said. "It's easier to claw your way up when you're reaching for the sunshine. That's how you get out of the hole."

Eckert's story has inspired her fellow sorority sisters.

"She has helped me so much and she has inspired me a lot and I know she has inspired a lot of other girls in the chapter," one Sigma Kappa sister told CBS News.

As she approaches her graduation this spring, Eckert hopes that her story has also reached the most important person.

"I go back to that last phone call, and I think he's really proud of me," she said.New study reveals eating too much sodium is No. 1 risk for diet-related death

The World Health Organization warned Thursday that people are ingesting more than twice as much salt as they should each day.

In the report, the WHO says that sodium, "an essential nutrient, increases the risk of heart disease, stroke and premature death when eaten in excess." Evidence also links high-sodium intake with increased chances of developing gastric cancer, obesity, osteoporosis and kidney disease.

Implementation of salt-reduction rules could save around 7 million lives by 2030, the report says. Around 1.89 million people suffer salt-intake-related deaths each year.

"Unhealthy diets are a leading cause of death and disease globally, and excessive sodium intake is one of the main culprits," WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said. "This report shows that most countries are yet to adopt any mandatory sodium reduction policies, leaving their people at risk of heart attack, stroke, and other health problems."

On average, people consume 10.78 grams of salt each day. WHO recommendations call for about 5 grams — approximately a teaspoon — per day.

In 2013, all WHO member states committed to reduce people's sodium intake by 30% by 2025, but only 5% of those countries have mandatory and comprehensive policies to cut down on salt, the organization said. Those policies include things like front-of-package labeling about sodium amounts and media campaigns to encourage cutting back on salt consumption. The WHO also advises reformulating food to be less salty and limiting sodium-heavy foods in schools, hospitals and nursing homes.

Federal guidelines in the U.S. suggest people consume no more than 2.3 grams of salt a day. Around 90% of Americans ages 2 and up consume too much sodium, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. More than 40% of American adults have high blood pressure.

How can you reduce your sodium intake on a daily basis? Here are some expert tips:

1. Choose packaged and prepared foods carefully

When shopping, the American Heart Association advises comparing nutrition labels and choosing the product with the lowest amount of sodium per serving. You can also opt for canned vegetables labeled "no salt added" and frozen vegetables without salty sauces added.

For fresh and frozen poultry, the AHA suggests making sure it hasn't been injected with a sodium solution. "Check the fine print on the packaging for terms like 'broth,' 'saline' or 'sodium solution,'" the group says.

2. Be careful with condiments

"For example, soy sauce, bottled salad dressings, dips, ketchup, jarred salsas, capers, mustard, pickles, olives and relish can be sky-high in sodium. Look for a reduced- or lower-sodium version," the AHA says.

3. Use flavoring alternatives

To replace or reduce the amount of salt you use when cooking, the CDC suggests using flavorful alternatives such as garlic, citrus juice, salt-free seasonings, herbs or spices.

4. Skip salt at restaurants

When dining out, ask that no salt be added to your meal, the CDC suggests. Or swap out salty side dishes in favor of no-salt-added vegetables or fruit.

5. Incorporate potassium-rich foods

"Potassium helps counter the effects of sodium and may help lower your blood pressure," the AHA notes, listing options such as sweet potatoes, potatoes, greens, white beans, kidney beans, nonfat yogurt, oranges, bananas, cantaloupe, tomatoes and lower-sodium tomato sauce.The three major credit reporting agencies have long drawn scrutiny for their practices, but Americans are growing more frustrated with the nation's Big Three as evidenced by the record number of complaints sent to the U.S. government's consumer protection agency, according to a new tally.

More than 800,000 complaints poured into the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in 2022, up 61% from 2021, according to a March analysis from the U.S. Public Interest Research Group. The increase comes as the Biden administration has proposed launching a new public credit reporting agency to compete with Equifax, Experian and TransUnion, the three largest credit bureaus.

TransUnion: Complaints about TransUnion totaled 186,802, up 183% from 2021, the PIRG analysis found. TransUnion complaints account for 23% of all complaints Americans filed with the CFPB last year.



Complaints about TransUnion totaled 186,802, up 183% from 2021, the PIRG analysis found. TransUnion complaints account for 23% of all complaints Americans filed with the CFPB last year. Equifax: Consumers sent in 184,666 complaints about Equifax last year, up 24% from 2021. Equifax, Experian and TransUnion combined accounted for 69% of all complaints Americans filed with the financial bureau, according to the PIRG analysis.

Americans filed 177,768 complaints about Experian last year, up 334% from 2021.



"I've studied credit reporting complaints for over 30 years, yet I cannot comprehend how little the credit bureaus' poor treatment of consumers has changed," said Ed Mierzwinski, senior director for federal consumer programs at U.S. PIRG Education Fund, in a statement. "When Americans describe a system rigged against them in the stories they file into the CFPB database, it's unfortunately not surprising -- I've seen it all before."

Here are the most common problems consumers described related to their credit reports, according to the consumer advocacy group.

Incorrect information

The CFPB received 229,638 complaints last year about inaccurate information on someone's credit report, PIRG found. Errors on credit reports can lead to lower credit scores, resulting in higher costs for consumers and making it harder to get loans.

Credit score concerns ballooned to three-quarters of all complaints in the first half of 2022, up from slightly more than half of all complaints sent to the federal agency in 2020 and 2021, the nonprofit consumer advocacy group found.

Wrote one consumer to TransUnion in a redacted complaint included in the PIRG analysis:

"Recently, I did an investigation on my credit report which cause severe XXXX upon me and found unverifiable, invalidated, inaccurate, and questionable items that your agency didn't make sure it was reporting 100% correct."

Improper use of credit reports

The second-most common complaint is the improper use of credit reports, which tallied 210,792 complaints from Americans last year. That includes a lender checking someone's credit score without the consumer's prior consent.

"This is an unfair system …" read one of several complaints posted by a CFPB official and shared in the PIRG analysis. Others included, "The credit reporting system is broken," and "This entire process is stacked against us as consumers …"

Problems getting errors fixed

Making matters worse, consumers also report having difficulty getting credit bureaus to correct errors. In a 2022 blog post, CFPB Deputy Assistant Director Darian Dorsey said the agency has "heard from consumers who expressed frustration that their attempts to have information corrected were ignored, seemingly tossed aside never to be heard from again."

One redacted consumer complaint to Equifax read:

"Hello my name is XXXX XXXX and XXXX have been reaching out to all three credit bureau's via mail trying to resolve this debilitating issue for the past 7 months to no available."

The PIRG analysis reveals the CFPB fielded 153,539 complaints about the credit bureaus not actively investigating an inaccuracy on someone's report.

Federal lawmakers are aware of the issue. Senators Elizabeth Warren, D.-Massachusetts, and Mark Warner, D.-Virginia, and Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D.-Illinois, pressed Equifax last August to explain why the company allowed hundreds of thousands of consumers to have incorrect information on their credit report and failed to fix the errors.It's a question that economists, psychologists and armchair philosophers have grappled with for centuries: Can money buy happiness?

Now, new research from a Nobel Prize-winning economist and fellow researchers provides a fresh answer. Money does appear to boost happiness — at least for most people — up to earnings of $500,000, according to the new paper published in this month in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences journal.

That contradicts earlier research from one of the economists involved in the new study, Daniel Kahneman, who in 2010 published an influential study with fellow Nobel Prize-winner Angus Deaton. The 2010 study found that money could only boost happiness up to a point — about $75,000 in annual earnings. Beyond that figure, the researchers concluded, money had little impact.

That notion that happiness tops out at $75,000 became so popular that Dan Price, the founder of credit card processor Gravity Payments, decided in 2015 to boost the minimum salaries of his employees to $70,000 — cutting his own salary to do so. The move brought him praise as an innovator and business leader in the process. (Price later stepped down after allegations of a pattern of abusing women.)

Yet new findings suggest that, for most people, happiness does improve with higher earnings — up to $500,000 a year. The research could have real-world implications for tax policies or compensation strategies, co-author Matthew Killingsworth of the University of Pennsylvania said in a statement about the latest findings.

"In the simplest terms, this suggests that for most people larger incomes are associated with greater happiness," Killingsworth noted.

Most people fall into one of two groups, the researchers found. Most people's happiness rises linearly with income, while about 30% of people are the "happiest," experiencing accelerating well-being once their earnings rise above $100,000.

"Adversarial collaboration"

The new study stems from a process called "adversarial collaboration," or when researchers with conflicting findings seek to resolve their dispute through joint research.

In this case, Kahneman paired up with Killingsworth after the latter's research contradicted his 2010 findings.

With co-author Barbara Mellers, also of the University of Pennsylvania, they ran a new experiment, asking 33,391 working U.S. adults with a median household income of $85,000 to answer questions about their sense of well-being.

Their new findings suggest that, for most people, happiness does improve with higher earnings, up to $500,000 a year — although participants above that income were "quite rare," providing a lack of comprehensive data for that group, the study notes.

"Rich and miserable"

Yet there is a smaller group of people for whom higher incomes don't make much of a difference, the researchers found. For this "unhappy group," comprising about 15% of people, the relationship between happiness and income is different, with additional money failing to improve their sense of well-being once they've hit $100,000 in annual earnings, according to the study.

These people may be suffering from life events that overwhelm any improvement that money might bring, the researchers posited.

"This income threshold may represent the point beyond which the miseries that remain are not alleviated by high income," Kahneman, Killingsworth and Mellers wrote. "Heartbreak, bereavement, and clinical depression may be examples of such miseries."

Or, as Killingsworth said in the statement, "[I]f you're rich and miserable, more money won't help."

On the flip side, the "happiest 30% experience feelings of well-being that sharply accelerate once they earn over $100,000, the study found.

That doesn't mean that money can solve all one's problems, Killingsworth said. And indeed, other research into the science of happiness has found that other aspects of life, from community to hobbies, has a measurable impact on contentment.

But money can contribute to a happier life, he added.

"Money is just one of the many determinants of happiness," he said in the statement. "Money is not the secret to happiness, but it can probably help a bit."A gunman opened fire on a crowded street in Tel Aviv, Israel, Thursday night, wounding three people. The gunman was killed by police, Israeli authorities said.

"A short time ago, a report was received of a terror attack in Tel Aviv," Israel Police said on Twitter. "A suspect shot 3 civilians who were wounded in different degrees. The terrorist was neutralised by police officers."

One of the victims was in critical condition, another was in severe condition and the third was in fair condition, police said.

The gunman was identified as a 23-year-old Palestinian associated with Hamas.

"Two policemen and two civilians who were in the area engaged with the terrorist and killed him," Israel Police tweeted a few hours after the shooting.

"There has been another terror attack in the heart of Tel Aviv tonight," said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who was in Rome at the time, in a statement. "We send our hopes and wishes for the speedy recovery of the wounded, and we strengthen the security forces and police who are fighting terrorists this night and every night."

Video taken by CBS News cameraman David Cohen of the aftermath of the shooting, which occurred on Dizengoff Street, showed large crowds of people, including police, medical personnel and civilians, gathered around what appeared to be two wounded victims lying in the street. The immediate area was quickly cordoned off by police as crowds of people who were out celebrating the start of the weekend, many of them attending parties for the festival of Purim, either fled or stayed behind trying to help.

Cohen said he was returning home from walking his dog when he heard about four shots and quickly ran upstairs and began filming the scene. At one point, bystanders could be seen directing an arriving police vehicle to where the gunman had fled. A short while later, several loud pops could be heard.

An image on social media showed what was believed to be the attacker standing in the middle of the road as he pointed a pistol. The MADA rescue service said one of the wounded was in critical condition, while authorities said security forces in the area quickly killed the shooter.

Amateur video appeared to show the attacker trapped in an alley as several armed Israelis stood around the corner. A man could be heard shouting "close the window" to a resident. As the suspect ran out of the alley, he was shot multiple times.

After the shooting, the Israel Defense Force said that it and "Israeli security forces" were at the gunmen's home in Ni'lin, which is located in the West Bank.

The shooting came hours after an Israeli military raid killed three Palestinian militants in the occupied West Bank.

Israeli security forces said they raided the village of Jaba to arrest suspects wanted for attacks on Israeli soldiers in the area. The suspects opened fire on Israeli troops, who shot back and killed three people, all affiliated with the Palestinian Islamic Jihad militant group, police said.

The Palestinian Health Ministry identified the men as Sufyan Fakhoury, 26, Nayef Malaisha, 25 and Ahmed Fashafsha, 22, and said they were shot by Israeli fire during the military operation. A fourth man was hospitalized with a bullet wound to the head, authorities added.

Israeli police released a photo of assault rifles, pistols, ammunition and explosive devices they said troops confiscated in Jaba, just south of the flashpoint city of Jenin. Gunmen shot down an Israeli drone during the clashes, the military said.

The Jaba militant group, a fledgling militia of disillusioned young Palestinians who have taken up guns against Israel's occupation, said members opened fire and hurled explosive devices at Israeli forces from a sedan — that now sits, smashed and bloodied, in the center of town. Residents said Israeli troops killed members of the group who had been recently incarcerated by Israel and had carried out a recent shooting attack at a nearby checkpoint.The rise of AI: Could ChatGPT take your job?

In the three months since artificial intelligence tool ChatGPT was introduced to the world, workers have already harnessed it to make their lives easier. Professionals in fields including real estate, health care and finance say they save time and work more efficiently using AI.

Here's how these workers described using the tool in their day-to-day jobs.

Write me a real estate listing

Mala Sander, a top real estate agent for the Corcoran Group who focuses on the Hamptons, has been using ChatGPT regularly for the past couple of weeks to help her write real estate listings and devise marketing strategies for properties.

"I asked it to write me ad copy about a house in Bridgehampton with a pool and tennis court on two acres and I listed the other features I wanted to highlight," she told CBS MoneyWatch. "And it would weave this fantastic copy into something that you could actually use."



She uses ChatGPT to change the tone of listings too. "I'll say things like, 'write this toward a millennial audience' or 'make it funny.'"

Her routine these days is to have her team write the first draft of a listing "and crunch it through to see if ChatGPT can edit it down and make it more concise," she said.

On a whim, she asked the bot to write her a marketing plan for one of her listings. It delivered. It gave her a breakdown of a campaign that would include digital, print and social outreach, she told CBS MoneyWatch.

"It talked about everything from direct mail to online digital advertising to social media, and it even came up with some percentages that might be ideal," Sander said.

Having worked as an agent for the last 20 years, Sander is quite capable and efficient without ChatGPT.

"But it is useful," she said. "It's like talking to another person, almost like having work therapist to say, 'Am I moving in the right direction with this or should be looking at some other things?'"

Elia Mazor, marketing manager for The Glazer Team at Corcoran, said he also uses ChatGPT to write listings and create other content.

"Sometimes you get writer's block, so I use ChatGPT for a bit of inspiration and to provide a different tone," he said.

He tells ChatGPT the topic he wants to address, and enters a prompt like: "ChatGPT, create an introduction on why estate planning is important."

It spits out paragraphs that Reynolds then edits in his own voice.

In a recent article on estate planning, Reynolds relied on ChatGPT to hook readers by driving home the message that "estate planning is an act of love for those you leave behind."

"I asked ChatGPT to explain that and it put together a few paragraphs on why it's thoughtful and considerate to do these things," Reynolds said.

The process took about 20 minutes. If he'd worked on the article alone, it would have taken closer to two hours, he said.

He doesn't use the tool to help clients make financial decisions — that's still a job exclusively for humans, according to Reynolds.

"Financial planning is so nuanced, individualized and personal. It is hard to envision using ChatGPT to spit out recommendations without it knowing the client. I see it being more valuable in generating educational material to supplement what I am doing," he said. "We don't just crunch numbers; we coach people, listen to their concerns and help them talk through emotional situations. The creative, empathetic work we do as humans is irreplaceable as of today."

Nick Meyer, another financial planner who produces shortform videos on TikTok, said he uses it as a starting point to come up with ideas for new content.

"I use it instead of Google search to get topic ideas, or to edit what I have already written," he said. It also helps him make his videos funny.

"I can insert a couple lines of a script and say, 'Make this more comedic, insert a joke on this line, or make it more concise," Meyer said.

"Gobs" of medical information

Board-certified emergency physician Harvey Castro is advising digital health companies on how to best integrate ChatGPT into the health care sector.

He says one good application is creating and translating patient discharge instructions — rules for them to follow after a medical visit.

An expert in emergency medicine, if he were asked a dermatology-related question he was unsure about, Castro said he'd enter the query into ChatGPT for more information. In the past, he relied on other clinical search engines and resources like MDConsult, now called ClinicalKey.

"I could type it in and it would give me gobs of information. So it's a supplement," Castro said.

Doctors are also using it to enter a patient's symptoms and have it return a differential diagnosis — a list of possible conditions related to the presenting symptoms, according to Castro.

"That is already happening today," he said.

Study buddy

Rushabh Doshi, a second-year medical student at Yale University School of Medicine, likes to use ChatGPT to create sample questions while he studies for the U.S. Medical Licensing Examination.

Test prep services have limited practice questions, and ChatGPT can generate new ones on any topic based on the prompt he feeds it.

It helps him prepare for some patient interactions, too, but uses it strictly for medical education and not patient care.

"If there is a patient coming in with a disease I am not familiar with, I can go to ChatGPT and read up on it," he said.

It also gives him information that helps him conduct more thorough patient evaluations. "I ask it to give me a guide of the types of questions to ask to make sure I am doing a comprehensive patient interview."Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin discuss their new film "Moving On" and over 40-year friendship

Longtime friends Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin co-star in a new film about two women seeking revenge on the husband of their late best friend.

Fonda said she was "shocked" at the audience's reaction to one of her key lines in the dark comedy "Moving On." The line is: "I'm gonna kill you. ... I'm gonna do it this weekend."

"I saw the movie with an audience, and they laughed," Fonda said. "I was shocked. I thought I'd failed."

But Tomlin said she knew Fonda's delivery of the line was funny — and praised her co-star.

"When you play it straight, really heavy, it makes it ... much funnier," Tomlin said to Fonda Friday on the set of "CBS Mornings." "You're arrogant in it. You're everything. It's amazing."

Fonda and Tomlin first worked together in the classic 1980 movie "9 to 5." They've been close friends ever since and have collaborated on many projects including the popular TV series "Grace and Frankie," which ended last year after seven seasons.

Fonda said she knew more than 40 years ago that she wanted to work with Tomlin after seeing her perform a one-woman show.

"That was it. I was in love. I mean, I just, I've never seen anything like it," Fonda said about Tomlin's performance. "She became so many different people, and just became them profoundly."

When it came to making "9 to 5," Fonda said, "I just thought, 'Well, I'm not going to make a movie about secretaries unless she's in it. I don't want to ever do anything without her.' I just was smitten."

After decades of parallel thriving careers, Tomlin said she called the director of "Moving On," Paul Weitz, and asked him to write something specifically for her and Fonda.

"It's just so natural and easy" for the two to work together, Tomlin said. "And people say we have chemistry. We don't know why or how, but it all works for us."

"Moving On" will be released in theaters on March 17.A California jury awarded a Black mother and her two daughters more than $8 million after local police detained them at a Starbucks.

The incident happened in September 2019 when Nevada mother Aasylei Loggervale was driving her two daughters to California for college. The trio stopped at a Starbucks in Castro Valley, California, to rest and were approached by Alameda County sheriff's deputies, according to court documents. Two deputies told the women they were searching for suspects in a recent rash of car thefts and asked for their identification, a lawsuit filed by the Loggervales against Alameda County alleged.

Loggervale refused to show her ID and was then "forcefully" detained and handcuffed, along with her daughters, after stepping out of her car, the suit alleged. Deputies held the women when the mother tried to walk toward the Starbucks to use the restroom, court documents state.

The Loggervales suffered abrasions on their arms and wrists from the incident, according to their suit. Attorneys for the Loggervales argued that the deputes involved in the incident — Steven Holland and Monica Pope, who are both White — stopped their clients because they are Black. The complaint accused the two of assault, battery, false arrest and violation of constitutional rights, among other charges.

The jury last week unanimously ruled against Holland and Pope, calling their conduct "unlawful." Holland and Alameda County together must pay $2.75 million to the mother and $2 million to each daughter, while Pope and the county must pay $750,000 to each daughter, the final order shows.

"The community's trust in my agency is foundational to my mission of maintaining a positive relationship with those we serve," Alameda County Sheriff Yesenia Sanchez told CBS MoneyWatch in a statement. "The facts of this case are extremely important to me and our community members, however, I must reserve my comments until the case has been fully adjudicated through the court system."

"Just fishing"

Craig Peters, one of the Loggervales' attorneys, said his clients received that amount partly because California's Bane Act allows juries to triple the amount of damages if the case involves a violation of an individual's constitutional rights.

"I think they were just fishing, which kind of goes back to racial profiling," Peters told CBS MoneyWatch of the deputies involved in the incident. "Cops have a lot of power. Sometimes that's a good thing and, in some cases that we've seen all too often recently, it's a bad thing."

Body-cam footage of the incident shows Holland asking Loggervale for her ID and the mother then instructing her daughter to start recording the interaction on her phone. Holland then asks Loggervale why her daughter is recording.

"I got to have protection because I don't know where this is about to go," Loggervale said.

The Loggervales were never accused or charged with a crime, the lawsuit states. Their attorneys also said the incident was inappropriate because a police report later indicated that the car thief suspects were men.

Holland and Pope have been promoted with the sheriff's office since the incident, Peters said. Meanwhile, the Loggervale sisters are enrolled at UCLA and UNLV and will both graduate this spring, he said.Deaf performer Justina Miles stole the show during Rihanna's Super Bowl halftime show -- and for the first time, she's opening up about her history-making performance.

Miles appeared on "CBS Mornings" to give her first interview since the big game. She appeared alongside Rihanna on the web livestream of the Eagles-Chiefs showdown, translating the pop star's medley into American Sign Language and leaping off the screen with her energetic performance.

Miles, a nursing student at Bowie State University in Maryland, told "CBS Mornings" co-host Gayle King that she was excited to be the first deaf woman to sign the Super Bowl halftime show. She also signed "Lift Every Voice and Sing" before the game started.

"I was thinking, before like getting there, 'I just hope that I pop off on a big scale, I hope I reach a big scale for the Deaf community," said Miles, who signed throughout the interview. "That's what I do and how I got in my zone."

Miles has some hearing, and said that she is able to hear music, but is still considered deaf based on audiologist measurements. While Miles is training to be a nurse so she can advocate for deaf patients and lead the way for nurses who are deaf, she said another job she dreamed of was being a dancer or performer, making her appearance at the Super Bowl even more special.

To get ready for the show, she started preparing as soon as she got the setlist five days before the big game.

"I was nervous," she admitted, laughing. "I got it. I was like 'I know all these songs.' ... What I did was look over the lyrics, make sure I got all the meanings right."

Miles said she also memorized the lyrics so she could "sign the lyrics and move to the beat" so audiences can "see the beat" rather than hear it. Performing wasn't just a matter of getting the lyrics right, she said. She wanted to "be as visual as possible" to match Rihanna's performance style and "show her art."

While Miles didn't actually meet Rihanna, they were able to chat over social media, where Rihanna complimented her energetic performance. Just like the rest of the world, Miles was surprised to learn that Rihanna was expecting her second child.

"She did not look pregnant!" Miles laughed. "It was a surprise ... I found out after, way after."Denim Richards, an actor on the hit Paramount Network show "Yellowstone," is celebrating the arts by hosting the Smithsonian Channel series "ArtNation," a one-hour blend of interviews with artists from around the world and classic profiles from CBS News' "CBS Sunday Morning" and "60 Minutes."

"What makes 'ArtNation' special is the fact that it celebrates the arts in disciplines from singing, acting, dancing, sculpting, concert piano, and the list goes on and on," said Richards. "I truly believe that this show also provides an amazing platform to new and aspiring artists, not just in the U.S., but all over the world. This show is a breath of fresh air, and there is an artist or story that everyone that watches will be able to resonate with."

The Smithsonian Channel's new series "ArtNation," features interviews with artists from across the globe. Smithsonian Channel

Along with the classic CBS News segments, Richards profiles local working artists to explore their inspirations and to provide a fresh look into the creatives who make everyone see the world a little differently.

Airing Tuesdays at 10 p.m. ET/PT, "ArtNation" episodes are organized by themes, from "Americana" to "Ambition" to "Rebels." The new eight-part series includes interviews with EGOT winner Viola Davis, ballet dancer Misty Copeland, designers Ralph Lauren and Betsey Johnson, actors Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig, author Stephen King and director Spike Lee.

"What I am excited about on 'ArtNation' is having the opportunity to bring so many amazing artists to TV screens all around the world," Richards said. "There are so many amazing stories to share, and I am honored to get to share these stories with the world."

Richards said each of the profiled artists had to overcome significant challenges.

"For some, it was not having a strong support system, others struggled with depression, many even felt somewhat outcasted or misunderstood from society because they were 'different' or had made mistakes in their past," he said. "Yet, through it all, they managed to overcome all of the obstacles and negativity and turned it into beautiful works of art that we all now get to take part in. Many artists go through struggles alone and yet share their gifts and blessings with the world. This is why I love 'ArtNation.'"King Charles III marked his brother Prince Edward's birthday by giving him a new title. Already the Earl of Wessex and Forfar, Edward was given the title of Duke of Edinburgh, Buckingham Palace announced Friday.

Prince Edward, who turned 59 on Friday, is the youngest of the late Queen Elizabeth II's children. The Dukedom of Edinburgh was last held by his father, Prince Philip, who was given the title when he married then-Princess Elizabeth, who was then the Duchess of Edinburgh. She then became the queen in 1952.

When Elizabeth died in September 2022, her eldest son Charles immediately became the king. Edward will hold the Duke of Edinburgh title for the rest of his life, the statement from the royal family said.

🎉 Wishing the new Duke of Edinburgh a very Happy Birthday today!

Prince Edward was first given the Earl of Wessex title when he married his wife, Sophie Rhys-Jones, in 1999, and the Earl of Forfar title in 2019 when he turned 55.

Only four other members of the royal family have had the Dukedom of Edinburgh bestowed upon them: Prince Frederick, King George II's son, who was the first to hold the title (1726), Prince William, King George III's brother (1764), Prince Alfred, Queen Victoria's son (1866), and Prince Philip, Queen Elizabeth II's husband (1947).

Although Prince Harry and Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, moved to the U.S. and stepped down as "working" members of the family, they have kept their titles, as has King Charles' other brother Prince Andrew, despite having many of his formal honors and patronages removed by the family in the wake of his legal battle over alleged sexual abuse.

Prince Harry, who is fifth in line to the throne after his brother, Prince William and William's children. Harry and Meghan's children follow him in the line of succession. Harry's young children Archie and Lilibet have taken the titles of prince and princess, which they have been entitled to since their grandfather ascended the throne late last year.

Eighth in line after the Sussex children is Prince Andrew. Prince Edward, the newly named Duke of Edinburgh, is 13th in line.

Last year, King Charles III made a move to allow his youngest siblings — Prince Edward and Princess Anne — to stand in for him.

Traditionally the four most senior royals and the sovereign's spouse can fill in for the monarch. When Charles became king, that list included his wife, Camilla, Queen Consort; his sons, Prince William and Prince Harry; his brother, Prince Andrew; and his niece, Princess Beatrice. Charles included his younger sister and brother because both Harry and Andrew have left their roles as senior working royals.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has updated its mammography regulations, which affect physicians and medical centers across the country.

As part of the new regulations, mammography facilities will have to notify patients about the density of their breasts. About half of American women over 40 have what's known as dense breasts. Having this type of tissue has been linked to a higher risk of developing breast cancer and can make it harder to diagnose the disease.

While similar laws have already been enacted in 38 states, including Colorado and Minnesota, this is the first nationwide regulation.

The new regulations will also "strengthen the FDA's oversight and enforcement of facilities and help interpreting physicians better categorize and assess mammograms," the agency said in a news release.

"Today's action represents the agency's broader commitment to support innovation to prevent, detect and treat cancer," said Dr. Hilary Marston, the FDA's chief medical officer. "Since 1992, the FDA has worked to ensure patients have access to quality mammography. The impact of the Mammography Quality Standards Act on public health has been significant, including a steep decrease in the number of facilities that do not meet quality standards. This means that more women have access to consistent, quality mammography. We remain committed to advancing efforts to improve the health of women and strengthen the fight against breast cancer."

What are dense breasts?

Dense breasts or dense breast tissue is the term used to describe the way some breasts look on a mammogram. Dense breasts have less fat and more tissue, so the images captured by standard mammograms may not show tumors or other masses. On mammographies, both masses and tissue show up as white.

These two undated photos, provided by the American College of Radiology shows an extremely dense breast, left, and a least dense breast. AP

Dense breasts are very common, according to the National Cancer Institute, an entity of the National Institute of Health. About half of women over 40 in the United States who get mammograms have been found to have dense breasts. The condition is often inherited, but can also be influenced by using menopausal hormone therapy and having a low body mass index, according to the institute.

Dense breasts can't be determined by self-exams or clinical exams, only mammograms.

Having dense breasts has been linked to 1.2-4 times higher risk of developing breast cancer. However, according to the institute, there is no link between dense breasts and death from breast cancer. According to the FDA, 1 in 8 women will have breast cancer in their life.

What do the FDA changes mean?

The FDA changes are amendments to regulations issued under a 1992 law that gives the FDA oversight over mammography facilities, but it's not until now that the FDA has used the law to require facilities to inform women if they have dense breast tissue.

The requirements must be implemented within the next 18 months, the FDA said in a news release. The amendments provide "specific language explaining how breast density can influence the accuracy of mammography," and recommends that patients with dense breasts talk to health care providers about their individual situation and risk.

"While nearly all certified mammography facilities continue to meet quality standards, today's updates, among other things, enhance the FDA's ability to communicate directly, if needed, with patients and their health care providers in cases where a facility did not meet quality standards and is not adequately communicating with patients about its deficiencies," the FDA said in a news release. "This is intended to help ensure important information that could affect decisions about patient care, such as the potential need for further evaluation or a repeat mammogram, is communicated as completely as possible."

The FDA said the changes bring the 1992 law "into the 21st century" and use current science and mammography best practices to improve breast cancer detections and empower patients.

The changes do not mandate that mammography facilities use more intensive tools to detect breast cancer. People with dense breasts may use other imaging tests, like ultrasounds or MRIs, but the United States Preventative Task Force, an independent expert panel that issues screening recommendations, has said that it is not yet clear if the use of these additional tests is beneficial.

The FDA continues to recommend that people get regular mammograms. The task force advises that women aged 50 to 74 get a mammogram every other year. Younger women may also choose to get screened depending on their individual risk factors and family history.Marlon Wayans praised fellow comedian Chris Rock for finally addressing last year's Oscars slap in a new comedy special and said he hopes Rock and Will Smith can reconcile and get past the infamous incident.

"It was good to hear him speak about it. You could tell it was passionate," Wayans told "CBS Mornings" in an interview Monday. "What you heard was somebody that was hurt, somebody that was finding their way to heal in that moment."

Rock discussed getting smacked by Smith in a Netflix special that streamed live over the weekend. In it, he brags about taking "that hit like Pacquiao" and suggests he was caught in the crossfire in Smith's relationship with his wife, Jada Pinkett Smith.

Wayans, whose own new comedy special takes a deep dive into the slapping incident, said he's spoken to the three of them separately and thinks both Rock and Smith are still hurt.

"I think Will's hurt has nothing to do with Chris. Maybe something that's happened in Will's life," he said. "That was a snap moment. That brother snapped. That's not Will. Will's composed."

Wayans said that if he had his way he would pull the pair into the principal's office and say, "We have to stop this."

"I don't think it's ever cool to hit somebody. But I do think that at some point we can't let that just sit there," he said. "I think for our children, for our people, for the people, that we just can't sit in pain and not come to terms. And I think we can all make mistakes, but at some point... let's sit down and come to the table and fix this."

In the new comedy special "Marlon Wayans: God Loves Me," which just dropped on HBO Max, the "White Chicks" and "Scary Movie" star discusses his life and career through the lens of the Academy Awards incident. He said he focused on the slap partly because he's known Rock since he was a child and was impacted by the incident.

"I felt like I had to talk about it because it affected my journey," he said.

Wayans is also guest-hosting "The Daily Show" this week. The show airs on Comedy Central, which is part of CBS News' parent company Paramount Global.Kids often worry about much different things than their parents do. One of the big ones is climate change. Research shows most youth are "extremely worried" about it, leading to a phenomenon called climate anxiety. Kids and young adults who struggle with this can perceive they have no future or that humanity is doomed.

"We see that a lot of young people are saying, I think my life will be worse than my parents' lives," said Dr. Sarah Schwartz, a professor of psychology at Suffolk University in Boston.

A study published last year collected attitudes about climate change from 10,000 people across the world, aged 16-25.

In the survey, 59% of youth and young adults said they were very or extremely worried about climate change and more than 45% said their feelings about climate change negatively affected their daily life and functioning.

"So, they know that the world is going to get to be a harder, darker, scarier place," said Schwartz. "And imagining themselves in that world feels really scary for them."

The study also revealed how climate change makes young people feel. In all countries surveyed, nearly 62% said they were anxious about climate change. About 67% said they were sad and afraid.

Schwartz is researching climate anxiety. She said it's not a diagnosis, but a valid response to the current situation in the world, and her research shows that three-quarters of young people report worrying about climate change.

"I don't think it makes sense as a disorder because, again, that one assumes that this is a psychopathology of a few rather than the majority," said Schwartz. "And then the goal is that it is this individual disorder, where we treat at the individual level rather than address the societal issues and the environmental issues."

"People should be talking about it more since it's their planet," said high school student Johanna Flores. "They should be worried about their health."

Flores lives in Chelsea, Massachusetts, just outside Boston, where she said there is so much jet fuel, road salt and heating oil stored on the river it's hard for some residents to even get close to the water.

"And you wouldn't see that in a white neighborhood, like you would see a beautiful view of the water," said 15-year-old Darien Rodriguez, who also lives in Chelsea. "You wouldn't see any industries, any like smoke and pollution."

The students are environmental activists at a non-profit called GreenRoots. They work alongside adults, advocating for environmental justice in their hometown by educating and empowering others to get involved.

"We're supposed to just partake in anything we can, like if there is some sort of thing going on of planting trees, like participate in that," said Flores. "Or if there's some sort of event, just even a trash pickup, people should participate in that because it helps the community so much."

With a group so focused on the environmental problems in their neighborhood, it's no surprise that they also worry about climate change.

"It's scary to think about what awaits the future generations and, like, the world itself," said 16-year-old Greandoll Oliva.

"I'm very concerned because I want to be able to have kids and watch their kids grow up and have a family," said Rodriguez. "I feel like I won't be able to experience that just because people are careless about what they do and how they treat the environment."

Getting involved helps

Schwartz said activism may be an effective way for kids to deal with the feelings associated with climate anxiety.

"Higher climate change anxiety is correlated with higher clinical symptoms of depression and anxiety," said Schwartz. "But what we saw was that for young people who have high levels of climate anxiety, if they also have high levels of activism, then we didn't see any higher levels of depression symptoms."

Schwartz said the social aspect and peer support of activism is most likely the biggest piece to help protect against depression.

"That may mean signing petitions," said Schwartz. "That may mean supporting other people who are the ones who are going to be the face of, you know, who are going to be going marching up to Beacon Hill over there," said Schwartz. "So, I think the idea of working with a group."

It could also mean building a "pop-up park" together in Chelsea, like the kids at GreenRoots have done.

"If there are more people working like this for a better future, there can be a change," said 16-year-old Greandoll Oliva.

"It helps me deal with it, like I'm not the only one," said 16-year-old Troy Arnold.

"There are moments where you're just like, well, nothing's ever going to change," said Rodriguez. "But then there's also that small feeling that there's still hope that people will change, and people will come together to help save humanity."

How you can get involved

Schwartz said when people think of activism, they often think of a protest or rally. She said there are other ways people can get involved and work with others, too. She recommends some of the following tools, guides, and resources:

Getting started

Are you interested in climate activism, but not sure where to begin? You can find climate toolkits and resources here, through Our Climate.

"In my assessment and those of economists across the board, a default on our debt would trigger an economic and financial catastrophe," Yellen said. "I urge all members of Congress to come together to address the debt limit without conditions and without waiting until the last minute."

The government reached the maximum amount it is able to borrow to pay the bills, known as the debt ceiling, in January. Lawmakers must act to raise or suspend that limit for the government to continue paying its bills, including paying its past debt built up under multiple administrations. The move would not greenlight new spending; that has been previously authorized by Congress — at issue is how to pay for what has already been spent.

Yellen's comments came during testimony before the House Ways and Means Committee, where she spoke about President Biden's budget proposal. The Treasury Department has been using so-called extraordinary measures to keep paying the bills since the government hit the debt limit. In a letter to congressional leaders, Yellen previously said that the government could be unable to pay the bills as soon as June. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that so-called X date would fall between July and September if Congress does not act.

The committee took up Republican-introduced legislation that would direct the Treasury to prioritize payments a day earlier. The legislation calls for the Treasury to first service the nation's existing debt and pay Social Security and Medicare benefits, followed by payments to members of the military and veterans benefits. It also would withhold pay for the president, vice president, executive appointees and members of Congress unless all other obligations are met.

But Yellen pushed back on the possibility of prioritizing payments, calling it "default by another name."

"We should not think that prioritization is a solution to the debt ceiling issue. Prioritization is simply not paying all of the government's bills when they come due," Yellen said. She said it is critical that the United States maintains its commitment to pay the bills.

"If we don't do that and think that there's some shortcut around it that will avoid economic chaos, we're kidding ourselves because not paying the government's bills will produce economic and financial collapse," she said Friday.

She said that not raising the debt limit would affect the government's ability to pay benefits and would cause interest rates to skyrocket. On prioritization, she noted Fitch Ratings recently stated a failure to pay all of the bills could potentially lead to a credit rating downgrade.

The White House and Republicans in Congress had been in a showdown over the debt limit for several months with GOP lawmakers urging the administration to release its budget proposal. Mr. Biden unveiled his $6.9 trillion plan on Thursday. During a speech in Philadelphia, he said he is willing to meet with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy any time to negotiate a deal.Federal authorities arrested a Maine man who planned to wear a full-size latex mask he'd asked undercover FBI agents to provide while committing the murder of a Manhattan businessman.

Hyunkook Korsiak was arrested on Wednesday night in a hotel parking lot after undercover FBI agents handed him $25,000 in cash to commit the murder, said a federal criminal complaint.

Korsiak, 41, was carrying a loaded Sig Sauer 9MM pistol in a black holster and the $25,0000 in cash upon his arrest, the complaint said. His car, a gray Chevrolet Malibu, which he drove down from Maine for the alleged murder, contained a small arsenal of weapons: AR-15 rifles, 9MM pistols, a bullet-resistant vest; and hundreds of rounds of various caliber ammunition, the complaint said.

Also found was a full-size latex mask Korsiak had requested during an earlier meeting and was planning on wearing during the murder to disguise himself, the complaint said. Korsiak had tried on the mask "to ensure" it fit properly, and would be sure to leave the mask behind, the complaint said.

A Maine man planned to wear this mask in an alleged murder-for-hire plot, federal authorities said. Department of Justice

The complaint said that federal agents targeted Korsiak as the man for the job after the Bureau of Prisons intercepted communications in which he allegedly said he wanted to make money for killing someone. Korisak has a lengthy criminal record in Maine. In 2011, he served more than two years in state prison, according to local court records, and in 2018 Korsiak was sentenced to 52 months for stealing guns, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office in Maine. He was released in November 2021, according to prison records.

Undercover agents posing as members of a "transnational criminal organization" approached Korsiak in August 2022 to murder the fictitious businessman in a Manhattan hotel, the complaint said.

"This person comes to New York and doesn't leave breathing," an undercover agent said doing one of their conversations, the complaint said, and Korsiak agreed, saying "You just tell me where to go and what to do and you know I can make that happen."

Earlier this year, Korsiak met undercover agents to coordinate plot details, the complaint said. He was allegedly given $5,000 in expense money, and he would clean the inside of the car with a pressurized bleach spray to remove any forensic evidence, the complaint said. Korsiak wanted to know if the cameras in the hotel were "obvious" or if were any hidden behind "two-way glass," the complaint said.

He also asked to be provided with silencers and a police uniform to use during the murder-for-hire, the complaint said.

Korsiak is charged with one count of murder-for-hire and one count of possession of a firearm.More than half of the world's population will be obese or overweight by 2035, according to a new report from the World Obesity Federation.

In the 2023 World Obesity Atlas report, the organization projected that 51% of the global population will be "living with overweight and obesity within 12 years if prevention, treatment and support do not improve."

If current trends prevail, the report also predicts childhood obesity could more than double compared to 2020 levels.

"Rates are predicted to double among boys to 208 million (100% increase) and more than double among girls to 175 million (125% increase) and are rising more rapidly among children than adults," the report states.

The World Health Organization defines overweight and obesity "as abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that presents a risk to health. A body mass index (BMI) over 25 is considered overweight, and over 30 is obese."

The increases forecast in the report would mean 1 in 4 people will be living with obesity, compared to 1 in 7 today.

"This year's Atlas is a clear warning that by failing to address obesity today, we risk serious repercussions in the future. It is particularly worrying to see obesity rates rising fastest among children and adolescents," said Louise Baur, president of the World Obesity Federation, in a statement about the report. "Governments and policymakers around the world need to do all they can to avoid passing health, social, and economic costs on to the younger generation. That means looking urgently at the systems and root factors that contribute to obesity, and actively involving young people in the solutions."

While obesity is often seen as an issue for wealthier countries, where rates are generally higher, the report found lower income countries are facing rapid increases‚ adding that these countries are the"least able to respond to obesity and its consequences."

"Of the 10 countries with the greatest expected increases in obesity globally (for both adults and children), 9 of those are from low or lower-middle income countries," the report states.

Overweight and obesity are risk factors for a number of chronic diseases, including cardiovascular diseases such as heart disease and stroke, diabetes and certain cancers. Childhood obesity is associated with a range of serious health complications as well as an increased risk of premature onset of related illnesses.

BMI is a formula that uses a person's height and weight ratio to assess whether they're underweight, normal weight, overweight or obese, although it is not a direct measure of body fat.

While it's a tool that's been used by doctors for decades, the system of measuring has increasingly coming under fire with critics denouncing BMI as not just unreliable but sexist and racist. And as CBS Reports found in a 2020, even many clinicians who see value in it also recognize its flaws.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention considers BMI an "inexpensive and easy screening method" that is "strongly correlated" with weight-related medical conditions.Netflix is cracking down on password sharing. What does that mean for users?

Netflix plans to start cracking down on subscribers in the U.S. who share their password for the streaming service by the end of March. But how exactly would that work?

Initial reports and trials in other countries suggest the effort to deter password-sharing will be relatively gentle in its first iteration, relying on a combination of technology and user conscientiousness to prod serial over-sharers into paying more for the privilege.

Netflix will likely use a person's geographic location, as determined by the IP address of any internet-connected device, to figure out which people count as "household" members who live together, Insider reporter Sarah Saril told CBS News.

"If you're watching on a TV, it'll provide exactly where you are," Saril said. "They only want people in your household, at your address, watching."

Netflix says on its website that the company uses "IP addresses, device IDs, and account activity from devices signed into the Netflix account" to determine which devices are in the same household.

"People who do not live in your household will need to use their own account to watch Netflix," the site says.

Stricter rules



Netflix told investors in January that it would roll out more stringent sharing rules by the end of March. More than 100 million households currently share Netflix passwords, the service said. That "undermines our long-term ability to invest in and improve Netflix," the company said in a statement accompanying its latest quarterly results.

It's a major turnaround for a company that six years ago tweeted, "Love is sharing a password." And Netflix executives know there's likely to be backlash.

"This will not be a universally popular move, so there will be current members that are unhappy with this move. We'll see a bit of a cancel reaction to that," Greg Peters, Neflix's recently promoted co-CEO, told investors on a call last week.

Will users leave?



The company tried password limits last year, when it asked members in Chile, Costa Rica and Peru to pay an additional fee to share with non-household members. The effort had mixed results. Tech publication Rest of World called the test "a mess," reporting that the new policy was rolled out inconsistently. Many users were able to avoid the extra charges, while others were prompted to pay more and responded by canceling their accounts, the outlet said.

Netflix predicted a similar response in the U.S. "From our experience in Latin America, we expect some cancel reaction in each market when we roll out paid sharing," the company told investors, noting that could hurt its viewership in the short term.

The rollout poses a risk to the premier streaming service, said Paul Verna, principal analyst at Insider Intelligence.

"You have to tread very carefully with these things, because you can't upset your customers," Verna told CBS MoneyWatch. "You can't charge a price point where people are going to be horrified and complain that this thing that's been free for so long is suddenly costing a lot of money.

Device verification



One way Netflix could limit the reach of an account is through multi-factor authentication. According to its website, the company might ask devices that log on from an unfamiliar IP address be "verified" before they're allowed to stream.

"[I]f your account is accessed persistently from a location outside of your household, we may ask you to verify that device before it can be used to watch Netflix," the website says.

To do this, Netflix says it will send a four-digit code to the account's primary email or phone number. The person logging on from a new device will have to enter the code within 15 minutes of logging in. This could be a relatively frequent occurence, Netflix says, noting that "Device verification may be required periodically."



Speaking to investors last month, co-CEO Peters described the company's goal as to "give [users] a little bit of a nudge and to create features that make transitioning to their own account easy and simple."

What's a household?



Netflix could turn off customers if it comes across as too heavy-handed, noted Verna.

"You also have to be sensitive about what you consider a household," he said.

He cited the example of a family whose children go to a sleepaway camp or go away to college, putting them geographically outside their "household." That should be treated differently than a household sharing with a person who's never lived there, he said.

Netflix has said it recognizes that the new policy is a major change for customers, and it has sought to cushion the blow by touting new features aimed at making the transition less painful. That includes letting members see all the devices using an account and making it easy for people to transfer individual profiles into separate accounts. Last fall, the service also introduced a dashboard that lets account users log out of individual devices.

"Tough conversations"



Netflix hasn't revealed the cost of any potential membership fees. However, in trials in Chile, Costa Rica and Peru, sub-memberships increased the monthly cost of an account by one-quarter or one-third, according to Variety. U.S. analysts who track the company expect an added member charge of around $3 to $4 a month, according to Netflix's most recent earnings call with investors.

"This is where these tough conversations come in — who is worth paying an extra fourth of your subscription cost every month?" Saril quipped.

The company's hope is to dramatically increase its paid viewership. Even though Netflix is the leader among streaming services in terms of subscribers, it commands only 8% of TV time in the U.S., executives said on the investor call.

However, it's walking a fine line between prodding users to pay more and not turning off too many casual viewers. Netflix also says users will not be automatically charged if the system detects too many location streams, nor will accounts be canceled. That's led some observers to question how effective the password crackdown will truly be.

"All signs indicate that the most aggressive Netflix intends to get in the first iteration of the paid-sharing rollout is to keep prodding violators with email reminders and notifications," Todd Spangler wrote in Variety in November.The White House said Thursday the administration will "reevaluate and assess" how the Department of Defense rectifies the less than honorable discharges many LGBTQ veterans received when they were kicked out of the service before and during "don't ask, don't tell." That comes after an investigation by CBS News found many of those kicked out for their sexual orientation are still struggling to get their honorable discharge status.

"It's concerning, it is very concerning that veterans who were unfairly discharged under the don't ask, don't tell have been facing these challenges to upgrade their discharges, denying them benefits they have earned," White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Thursday. "It's something that we definitely are going to look into."

During the 18 years when "don't ask, don't tell" was the law of the land, an estimated 14,000 service members were forced out of the U.S. military, in some cases with discharges that deprived them access to full benefits including VA loan programs, college tuition assistance, health care and some federal jobs.

The discriminatory policy was born of a compromise by President Bill Clinton to allow gay, lesbian and bisexual military personnel to remain in the armed forces as long as they remained closeted. The controversial law was repealed in 2011 under President Barack Obama.

Donnie Ray Allen, a Marine veteran, and Amy Lambre, who served in the Navy, both say the early years of "don't ask, don't tell" brought a fresh wave of homophobia to the military. They were both dismissed from duty with less than honorable discharges and say they've spent years suffering from the emotional fallout.

"I'm 'less than' … less than honorable," Lambre said, explaining how this discharge changed her sense of self. "It's a dark place."

There are official channels that would open doors for those veterans who were less than honorably dismissed, that would give them access to benefits they would have otherwise been entitled to. But servicemembers told CBS News that many of those who qualify have been reluctant to seek an upgrade because they believe it's difficult to access.

"The Department has conducted several outreach campaigns to inform all Veterans who believe they have suffered an error or injustice to seek correction to their military records," the Department of Defense told CBS News. "This effort included an individualized letter campaign during the 5th anniversary of the repeal of DADT policy to those who may have been personally impacted."

On Capitol Hill, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat who serves on the Veterans Affairs Committee, called for a review of the upgrade process after the CBS News report.

"The discharge upgrade system needs to be reviewed because right now, the burden is totally on the veteran who may be completely uninformed about what their rights are," Blumenthal said.

Lambre says she first started the process in 2013 without success. "It just got stalled and I didn't feel like there was any hope for anything," she said.

The Navy said it would not comment on Lambre's case due to privacy.

Two weeks ago, Allen learned his discharge upgrade had come through, giving him access to benefits he previously couldn't access like VA loans and tuition assistance.

"It's an absolute 100% game-changer. Things that I never thought that I could do or get or have or attain now are attainable," Allen said after receiving the news.
